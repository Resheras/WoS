NCT05523284,Combining Ultrasound and Biomarkers to Diagnose Superficial Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05523284,SPGENDO,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease characterized by uterine-like cells growing outside the uterus, leading to pain, infertility, and inflammation. Endometriosis most commonly occurs in the forms of Superficial Endometriosis (SE), Deep Endometriosis and Ovarian Endometriosis (Endometrioma) (OE). Ultrasound diagnosis of DE and OE has become more reliable with advances in ultrasound technology, technique and expertise, leading to decreased diagnosis time for patients and allowing for better optimization of surgeries if required. SE, however, lacks any reliable non-invasive diagnosis methods.

SE is the most common form of endometriosis and is defined as a disease that lines the peritoneum and is small and superficial in nature, leading to chronic inflammation, infertility, and pain. SE is difficult to visualize on ultrasound due to its size and alignment with tissue, requiring fluid to expand the pelvis and partially suspend these small lesions, allowing them to be diagnosed through ultrasound. Leonardi et al. observed that in some patients, a physiologic change occurs whereby fluid fills the pouch of Douglas (POD), allowing increased visualizing during ultrasound. This led to the development of Saline-infused sonoPODgraphy (SPG), a novel method utilizing modified commonly used ultrasound techniques called saline-infusion sonohysterography (SIS) and hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy), to reliably visualize the POD (Leonardi et al, 2019). Visualizing the POD is important as SE is often deposited in the POD.

This diagnostic accuracy pilot study aims to pioneer the technique whereby SPG will be evaluated as a novel, rapid, non-invasive diagnostic tool for SE. The injected fluid from the POD will be withdrawn and evaluated for novel biomarkers, allowing us to further develop rapid diagnostics and better understand disease mechanisms. We hypothesize that SPG will allow for the diagnosis of SE with a diagnostic accuracy parallel to the current invasive gold standard, laparoscopy.",NO,Endometriosis (Diagnosis)|Endometriosis,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: SonoPODography,"Determine the diagnostic accuracy of SPG as a non-invasive diagnostic modality for superficial endometriosis, in the absence of DE, OE, and POD obliteration., The diagnostic accuracy of SPG and biomarkers will be compared to the current gold standard, laparoscopy and histology., 2022-2024","1.

Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease with the growth of endometrial tissue outside the endometrium. In all its properties, this tissue is similar to the mucous membrane of the uterus.

Types of endometriosis:

Endometriosis is divided into genital and extragenital. Genital endometriosis is internal and external. When the inner is affected by the uterus, with the external - the ovaries, tubes, vagina and external genital organs are affected. Extragenital endometriosis can affect various organs of the abdominal cavity.

Drug treatment does not show high effectiveness. Surgery / laparoscopic is currently considered the gold standard treatment for this problem, including infertility treatment.

The purpose of our studies is to achieve substantial results with respect to tolerability, safety and clinical efficacy of vaginal suppository ELTA for treatment of the endometriosis.

NCT06286371,Pelvic Neuro-Angiogenesis in Deep Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06286371,,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is observed in one out of every ten women in society, causing endometrial cells to be found outside their normal location in the body and proliferate in other locations, leading to fibrosis in the tissue due to the secretion of various factors from the cells. Additionally, the substances secreted by the cells can cause various other changes in the tissue besides fibrosis. Increased neurogenesis and neovascularization are among the primary changes, which occur as a result of the secretion of substances from the cells. Increased neovascularization, neurogenesis, and fibrosis in the tissue lead to the formation of nodular structures in the pelvic region, resulting in pain development in women.

Nodular formations in the pelvic region due to endometriosis are especially observed in the rectovaginal space. Despite being small in size, they can induce increased neovascularization and neurogenesis even in healthy peritoneal tissue due to the microenvironment they create, leading to different clinical symptoms clinically. However, it is not known how far these changes occur around the endometriotic nodule in the presence of endometriosis.

In this project, in patients operated on due to endometriosis, the density of nerve and vascular structures in the surgical margins of the peritoneal tissue excised along with the nodule, and the synthesis and release of chemical mediators causing pain (e.g., Bradykinin, Substance-P) are evaluated.

NCT05951452,The Developmental Origins of Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05951452,ENDOHaD,RECRUITING,"Introduction:

Endometriosis is a common pathology affecting one in 10 women, characterized by the ectopic development of endometrium, which can cause pain and/or infertility. This pathology is primarily determined by hereditary factors, but it is also susceptible to environmental influences, such as the age of the onset of menstruation or exposure to chemical substances that modify the endocrine system. Recent studies have highlighted that endometriosis is more common in women with relatively short ano-genital distances (AGD), and that sensitivity to pain is closely linked to adult levels of testosterone (T) or oxytocin (OT).

Aim:

The main objective is to compare the anogenital distance (AGD) between two groups of women: one with stage III or IV endometriosis (ENDO +) and another group without endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy (ENDO -).

The secondary objectives are to compare various factors between the 2 groups :

* Basal testosterone levels in blood.
* Variations in blood testosterone levels before and after a video stimulating empathy.
* Basal oxytocin levels in saliva.
* Variations in oxytocin levels in saliva before and after an empathy-stimulating video.
* Pelvic pain, between D2 and D5 after the start of the menstrual cycle.

For the ENDO + group only:

* Evaluate patients' quality of life, between D2 and D5 after the start of the menstrual cycle.
* Correlate pain experienced over the last 4 weeks with hormonal markers (AGD, T, OT).

Methods:

Participants in the ENDO+ group will fill in a questionnaire assessing the impact of pain experienced over the past 4 weeks on their quality of life. D0 is defined as the day when participants experience a menstrual bleed before 10 am. All participants will return for project-specific hospital appointment between D2 and D5 after the start of their menstrual cycle to measure T, Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) and OT.

During this consultation, the following samples will be taken:

* 10mL blood sample
* 2mL saliva sample

Both samples will be taken at t0 (before watching the video) and t1 (20 minutes after watching the video).",NO,Endometriosis,OTHER: Blood samples for testosterone and SHBG measurements|OTHER: Saliva samples for oxytocin measurements,"Measure of the anogenital distance (AGD), AGD is measured at enrollment for patients already diagnosed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and it is measured during the laparoscopy once the diagnosis has been confirmed.

It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various classification thresholds. In other words, the model's sensitivity corresponds to the model's ability to detect patients (ENDO+) while the model's specificity corresponds to the model's ability to detect a non-patient (ENDO-). The ROC curve helps assess the model's ability to correctly identify true positives while minimizing false positives.

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be interpreted as the probability that, among two randomly chosen subjects, a patient and a non-patient, the value of the marker is higher for the patient than for the non-sick. An AUC of 0.5 (50%) indicates that the marker is non-informative. An increase in AUC indicates an improvement in discriminatory abilities, with a maximum of 1.0 (100%)., At diagnosis (ENDO+) or at enrollment (ENDO-)|Pelvic pain intensity, Pelvic pain will be assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

NCT06314126,Evaluation of D-Chiro-Inositol Treatment in Women With Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06314126,ENDO-DCI,RECRUITING,"To date, the treatment for endometriosis is represented by the surgical removal of the lesions. Nonetheless, in the years following surgery, the lesions can recur, often due to excessive estrogen production. To balance estrogen, progestin- or estrogen-progestin-based medications are generally prescribed. On the other hand, progestins and estrogen-progestins act as contraceptives, preventing the onset of a pregnancy. At the same time, these can have side effects that can affect up to 30% of patients. For these and other reasons, some women refuse therapy with progestins or estrogen-progestins, preferring to resort to no treatment.

Considering the need to research effective molecules in the prevention of relapses that can maintain fertility and avoid unwanted effects, the research focuses on natural molecules, well tolerated by the body.

D-Chiro-Inositol (DCI) is a polyol normally present in human cell membranes, where, from a metabolic point of view, it acts as a second messenger of insulin, while from a hormonal point of view, it exerts an on the biosynthesis of androgens. This effect on steroidogenesis can be attributed to more than one mechanism. In the ovary, DCI stimulates direct testosterone production. Furthermore, it stimulates the accumulation of testosterone by reducing the activity of the aromatase enzyme, responsible for the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Considering the responsiveness of endometriosis to estrogens, and that these constitute a risk factor for recurrences following surgical removal, the use of DCI could be interesting from a clinical point of view.

The most common symptom is pelvic pain. One of the treatment options that has been proven effective in treating endometriosis symptoms, including endometriosis pain, is triptorelin. Triptorelin has also received a distribution permit in Indonesia for the treatment of endometriosis.

However, patient compliance in using this drug is very low due to high medical costs and side effects of the drug. Standard treatment with triptorelin is generally given every 4 weeks. A previous preliminary study showed that triptorelin could be given at 6-week interval and provided treatment results that were no different from those at 4-week interval. This is certainly better, because with longer interval doses it can reduce medical costs, reduce side effects due to hormone suppression and can increase patient compliance in undergoing treatment. Therefore, in this study triptorelin will be given to 2 groups and observed for 18 weeks. The first group will be given triptorelin twice before surgery, each with an interval of 6 weeks, at baseline and week-6. Then triptorelin will be given again once after surgery at week-12. In the second group, triptorelin will be given once after surgery at week-12.

NCT05619757,Compliance and Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05619757,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is defined as the presence of hormone-dependent endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is a chronic, painful and often disabling pathology during the normal activities of daily life. It affects 10% of women of childbearing age. It is therefore a real public health issue.

The latest recommendations from the HAS and the CNGOF now recommend primary medical management of endometriosis in painful women who do not wish to become pregnant. It should be remembered that until very recently, the teams resigned themselves to carrying out surgical interventions in order to support the diagnosis (this is histological and requires a biopsy) and to treat the patient if possible. Sometimes, this treatment was not possible from the outset, as the lesions appeared to be inaccessible, and additional hormonal treatment was therefore required. The current concept is to propose to patients a first hormonal suppressive treatment before a possible surgery. This therapeutic de-escalation should be considered in the light of the physiopathology of endometriosis, which is essentially based on the ovarian cycles, and indirectly on menstruation, which must then be suspended. However, a good number of patients are initially reluctant to undergo any kind of hormonal therapy, either because they have had a bad experience with hormonal contraception (intolerance) or because of a fear related to the possible complications of hormonal therapy with third or fourth generation pills, for example (thromboembolic risk). There is also a health alert at present concerning macro progestins in relation to the risk of meningioma. Acceptance of the principle of instituting amenorrhea in order to relieve patients suffering from endometriosis requires prior information. In investigator's daily practice, they frequently deplore non-compliance, which is detrimental to the proper management of the disease.

Exposure can occur in living environments and in specific workplaces in which these substances are produced or used.

These substances present dangerous characteristics, particularly associated with reproductive toxicity, and their xenoestrogenicity led some authors to evaluate a possible involvement in the aetiology of endometriosis.

In this proposed study the investigators aim to clarify a potential association between endometriosis and phthalates exposure.

An ""ad hoc"" questionnaire will be administered to the patient to collect the necessary information on the characteristics of endometriosis as well as their lifestyle and work habits.

The biological monitoring will be carried out measuring the urinary levels of phthalate metabolites. In order to produce reliable data and to reduce the possible contamination caused by the contact with plastic materials, samples will be analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).

It is a common disease that affects 7-10% of women around the world. The most common symptoms are pain and infertility. The diagnosis is histological after removal of lesions with laparoscopy (sensitivity 94%, specificity 79%), and treatment is symptomatic.

At present, there is not a laboratory test that allows early and adequate diagnosis of endometriosis and therefore it can take up to 10 years for a patient to be diagnosed and patients often suffer from the disease.

NCT04333017,Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation of Parietal Endometriosis (PRFA),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04333017,PRFA,COMPLETED,"Parietal endometriosis is the implantation of endometrial tissue in abdominal structures more superficial than the peritoneum. It is a rare form of the disease (incidence estimated between 0.04 and 12% among women operated on for endometriosis depending on the series) but is classically resistant to medical treatment and can be disabling. Surgical resection is currently the reference treatment in the event of failure of hormonal treatment, despite the sometimes significant skin scars and the risk of parietal fragility that may require a cure of venting by parietal prosthesis. The recurrence rate after surgical resection is 4.3%. The use of radiofrequency for therapeutic purposes is nowadays described in multiple applications such as cardiac arrhythmia, neurological and spinal disorders, as well as for the treatment of liver, kidney, prostate, breast, lung or skin cancers. Its use has already been reported in the field of benign gynecology with, in particular, demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of uterine fibroids by laparoscopic, trans-vaginal or percutaneous means. There are also large published series on radiofrequency for the treatment of adenomyosis, by the transvaginal and laparoscopic route.

In the context of parietal endometriosis, this would be a minimally invasive, percutaneous treatment. Ultrasound guidance allowing good targeting of the lesions and the procedure would most often be carried out on an outpatient basis and under local anaesthesia. And in case of failure or partial effectiveness, the reference treatment would remain accessible for these patients.

There is only one published case of the use of radiofrequency in parietal endometriosis (case reports). Despite results that seem encouraging in terms of a rapid and prolonged therapeutic effect on symptoms, no further cases or series have been published since.

Our study aims to investigate the feasibility of percutaneous radiofrequency treatment for parietal endometriosis, with the secondary objective of evaluating the safety, efficacy and risk factors for failure of the technique.

NCT06217315,Endometriosis and Health Care System Utilization in British Columbia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06217315,EndoCare,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Purpose \& Background Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition believed to affect 8-10% of reproductive-age women and an unmeasured number of gender-diverse people. It is a common cause of pelvic pain and infertility, is now known to be associated with other conditions such as heart disease and ovarian cancer and can have a devastating impact on a woman's ability to function and achieve their full potential. It has been shown that endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain are associated with considerable costs to the health-care system in Canada. The in-patient hospital costs for chronic pelvic pain were estimated to be $25 million/year and the total societal costs for endometriosis were estimated to be 1.8 billion/year.

Standard therapies for endometriosis and pelvic pain include pain medications, hormonal suppressive therapies, and surgery. There is a tertiary referral centre of excellence for endometriosis at BC Women's Hospital (Centre for Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis), which provides advanced surgical treatment of endometriosis and interdisciplinary care for patients with endometriosis who have developed other pain comorbidities (e.g. due to central nervous system sensitization). Central sensitization responds best to treatments targeted to the nervous system, such as Interdisciplinary care includes pain education, physiotherapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapies. One randomized trial has shown the benefit of an interdisciplinary approach compared to standard treatment for the management of chronic pelvic pain. At our centre, the investigators reported improvements in pain, mental health, quality-of-life, and self-reported reduction in health care utilization, after interdisciplinary care, utilizing our ongoing prospective registry. However, a formal economic analysis of health care system utilization is required to quantify savings to the health care system with an interdisciplinary approach to endometriosis.

Despite surgery being a common treatment of endometriosis, there is variability in outcome and a gap is the lack of ability to predict outcomes after endometriosis surgery. For example, utilizing self-reported outcomes from our registry, the investigators found that poorer outcome after endometriosis surgery was found in patients with evidence of pain comorbidities and central sensitization (as surgery is not a direct treatment of these factors) (in preparation). Moreover, the investigators have a biobank and have been studying biomarkers in surgically excised endometriosis tissue that may predict outcomes after surgery. These biomarkers include somatic cancer driver mutations and neuroinflammation. The investigators have preliminary data that suggests that these biomarkers may predict rates of re-operation at the centre. Beyond self-reported outcomes and re-operation at the centre, there is a need to assess health care utilization and re-operation occurring throughout the province as additional outcomes that may be associated with our clinical and biomarker predictors.

Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound physical and mental health effects on populations worldwide. However, there exists limited empirical evidence focusing on the wellbeing of patients with endometriosis and/or pelvic pain during the public health crisis. Herein, the investigators propose to compare a pre-pandemic cohort to a pandemic cohort of subjects with endometriosis and/or chronic pelvic pain, again in terms of health care system utilization.

Therefore, the overall purpose of this project is to assess health care utilization patterns of patients with endometriosis in British Columbia, and to perform an economic analysis of interdisciplinary care, evaluate clinical-biomarker predictors of surgical outcome, and assess the impact of the covid pandemic.

NCT04150406,Flexofytol® for the Treatment of Endometriosis- Associated Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04150406,ENDOFLEX,UNKNOWN,"Endometriosis is a benign disease that affects 6-10% of women of reproductive age. The wide range of symptoms observed in patients with endometriosis is due to implantation of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. This ectopic endometrium is subjected to cyclic changes similar to that of eutopic endometrium. Typically, ectopic lesions are found in the pelvis, notably on the ovaries in the form of cysts (endometriomas), as well as the rectouterine and vesicouterine pouch. Lesions have also been described in other parts of the abdomen and in other locations outside the abdominal cavity.

Although endometriosis has also been described in asymptomatic patients, possible symptoms range from mild to severe pain presenting itself as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or dyschezia, or as infertility. Since the clinical picture varies, the treatment of this disease has become quite personalized. Many studies conducted over the past several years have presented different treatment options for the symptoms caused by endometriosis.

Turmeric, which is won from the rootstalks of Curcuma longa, has more than 300 biologically active elements. One of the three main curcuminoids that are derived from turmeric, is curcumin. Several in-vitro and animal studies have described anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of curcumin.

The main objective for the treatment of endometriosis patients is symptom relief. Treatment options include analgesic therapies, hormonal therapies, laparoscopic surgery or a combination of these. For patients who refuse hormonal therapies however, conservative treatment options are limited.

Curcuma is a substance that has been in use for centuries, especially in ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of various symptoms, notably for pain alleviation in inflammatory illnesses. Several recently published studies have shown very promising results of Flexofytol for pain alleviation in patients with osteoarthritis, due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.

However, only reference ultrasound, performed by a doctor specialized in the disease and carried out according to a specific protocol (such as UBESS), is sufficiently reliable for diagnosis. The number of practitioners performing this type of examination is very low in France, which in practice results in a very low reliability of this strategy in real life.

The main stakes of this disease are that it is benign but difficult to diagnose, often very painful, difficult to predict, potentially recurrent, while being resolvable at menopause. It affects women of childbearing age and can cause infertility and pain during intercourse. Also, by its characteristics, it can significantly deteriorate the quality of life.

The management of endometriosis, from diagnosis to treatment, is not consensual. There are medical or surgical treatments depending on the severity of the lesions, their location and the severity of the symptoms. Deep endometriosis, that is to say when there is digestive, urinary, utero sacral or peritoneal ligament more than 5mm deep, poses, in particular, a therapeutic problem because surgery is often the only option but it can be decadent.

Due to genital involvement, this disease has a real impact on the sexuality of patients. Surgery allows in a number of cases to reduce pain, including those occurring during intercourse.

NCT04394468,The Use of plasmaJet During Operative Laparoscopy for Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04394468,PLASMA,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is a condition where functional endometrial tissue is present outside the uterus. It usually locates in the pelvis, which often includes the ovaries. One of the main concerns when performing surgery is to maintain fertility.

Nevertheless, a disadvantage of using monopolar and bipolar instruments for laparoscopic excision or coagulation of endometriosis lesions is the energy / thermal distribution that can cause damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Therefore, the use of ultrasound, laser or plasma energy can potentially reduce damage to surrounding tissues and prevent adhesion formation. In addition, ablation of the internal surface of endometriomas can be an effective alternative to cystectomy.

The PlasmaJet system uses argon plasma which is released as kinetic, light and / or thermal energy. In this way the instrument can be applied within three functions, namely cutting, vaporizing and coagulating. Moreover, plasma will dissipate very quickly upon contact with tissue which consequently allows a controlled depth of tissue penetration. Thirdly, pure plasma energy differs from conventional electrosurgery since no electrical current will be spread through the tissue and therefore the thermal effect at surrounding tissues remains minimal.

NCT05362838,Conventional Laparoscopy Versus Robotic Surgery for Pain Relief in Patients With Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05362838,,UNKNOWN,"Background: Endometriosis is a common disease, affecting women in their reproductive age suffering from infertility, adnexal masses and chronic pelvic pain, obstruction of the bowel or urinary tract. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is defined as a solid endometriosis mass situated more than 5 mm deep to the peritoneum. These lesions are considered very active and are strongly associated with pelvic pain symptoms.

Surgery is recommended in women with pain resistant to medical therapy and in women with contraindications to or refusal of medical therapy. Further indications for surgical treatment are the need of excluding malignancy in an adnexal mass, obstruction of the bowel or urinary tract. It is hypothesized that in patients with lesions in complex anatomic sites, a robot-assisted approach may provide improved instrument articulation compared with conventional laparoscopy, but no data are available.

Aims: The aim of this study is to perform a pilot study investigating differences between robot-assisted laparoscopy compared to conventional laparoscopy regarding subjective symptom outcome, evaluated by VAS score for non-menstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea.

Study population: The study population will consist of women aged between 18 and 51 years who are referred to our gynecologic outpatient clinic due to symptomatic endometriosis. Women with suggested DIE and an indication for surgery can be included in this trial.

Methods: Laparoscopic-assisted resection of endometriosis will be performed using up to five 5-mm ports, including an umbilical port and additional ports as dictated by each individual surgery. The robotic-assisted resection of endometriosis will be performed using the da Vinci Surgical System Si (Intuitive Surgical) using up to five ports as needed. Superficial and deep endometriosis resection will be performed in the usual standard fashion. Histological confirmation of endometriosis will be performed. The primary outcome is subjective symptom improvement.

NCT03860909,Pelvic Endometriosis: Correlation of US and MRI With Laparoscopic Findings,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03860909,,UNKNOWN,"Endometriosis is classically defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity and its musculature.

The definition of deep endometriosis is based on anatomic assumptions that may prove erroneous.

In fact, the term '' deep endometriosis '' should be reserved for lesions in the retroperitoneal tissue. For practical purposes, several reports included in the so-called deep endometriosis the infiltrative forms that involve vital structures such as the bowel, ureters, and bladder, as well as forms such as many rectovaginal lesions. For the term ''deep'' to apply, there should be ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating the peritoneum more than 5 mm in depth.

The ectopic endometrium responds to hormonal stimulation with various degrees of cyclic hemorrhage which result in suggestive symptoms and appearances.

A common symptom is infertility. Pelvic pain is a frequent complaint among patients with endometriosis. Such pain generally manifests as secondary dysmenorrhea, worsening primary dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or even noncyclic lower abdominal pain and backaches. The pain may be site-specific when endometriosis is found in unusual locations outside the pelvis.

Diagnosis Physical examination and laparoscopic exploration may not allow diagnosis or prediction of the extension of deep pelvic endometriosis, especially in pelvic retroperitoneal sites.

Transvaginal sonography is recommended for diagnosis of endometriomas and endometriosis of the bladder but its value for assessment of superficial peritoneal lesions, ovarian foci, and deep pelvic endometriosis is uncertain.

MR imaging is now commonly used for diagnosis of endometriosis and provides a tremendous advantage over other methods of investigation, owing to the possibility of making a complete survey of the anterior and posterior compartments of the pelvis at one time.

NCT05527002,Thoracic Endometriosis: A Cohort Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05527002,TORENDO,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory disease. Estimates show that up to 10% of premenopausal women have endometriosis. The most frequent forms of endometriosis are superficial peritoneal implants, ovarian cysts and deep nodules or plaques. However, the pelvis is not the exclusive site of endometriotic lesions: endometriosis can also affect the diaphragm, the pleura and the lung. All these localizations are included in the spectrum of ""thoracic endometriosis"".

Thoracic endometriosis may present with cough, wheezing, catamenial pneumothorax, hemothorax, hemoptysis and pulmonary nodules. If the diaphragmatic pleura is also involved, catamenial periscapular or neck pain may be associated with irritation of the phrenic nerve. The symptoms of thoracic endometriosis generally have catamenial onset. Thoracic endometriosis rarely occurs isolated. It is considered a progression of pelvic endometriotic disease. Due to its varied presentation, diagnosis can be particularly difficult and often only identified due to clinical suspicion. The instrumental diagnosis of pneumothorax and catamenial hemothorax can be obtained by radiography or computerized axial tomography of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging is to be preferred in case of diaphragmatic involvement. The gold standard remains exploratory laparoscopy, possibly accompanied by Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS).

The first-line treatment is hormone therapy, aimed at suppressing ovulation and also preventing the onset of relapses. GnRH analogues are very effective in reducing the painful symptoms associated with endometriosis, but are not superior to other first-line treatments available. Furthermore, the prolonged hypoestrogenism can cause menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis.

Surgery should be considered a second-line treatment in case of intolerance or ineffectiveness of medical therapy. The surgical approach is multidisciplinary and involves the endoscopist gynecologist and the thoracic surgeon expert in VATS.

The principal aim of the study is the retrospective evaluation of thoracic endometriosis cases in our clinic over the last 20 years in order to evaluate the effectiveness of medical and surgical treatments in terms of satisfaction of patients suffering from this clinical condition.

In patients suffering from endometriosis retrograded menstrual cells induce an inflammatory response.Endometriosis has also been considered to be an autoimmune disease, owing to the presence of auto antibodies, the association with other autoimmune diseases and recurrent immune-mediated abortion.

We aim to study this aberrant regulation of endometrial cell apoptosis by investigating the peripheral blood immune system of patients suffering from endometriosis.

Hypothesis:

We hypothesized that immune peripheral mononuclear cells of patients suffering from pelvic endometriosis react differently to eutopic endometrial cells than matched control women group. This difference could be study on a molecular, antigenic and/or apoptotic cycle gene expression.

Our goal with the study is find a correlation between the ""aggressivity"" of endometriosis with clinical factors determined in our study questionnaires. The ""aggressivity panel"" was pioneered by the EndoDiag lab in France, and was created using markers thought to affect the activity or progression of endometriosis. This information could lead to a better understanding of the disease, and ultimately lead to more targeted therapies.

If a patient returns for a second surgery we will ask their permission to use their slides from their first and seconed surgery to compare. The tissue that is being removed during the surgery as standard of care to make slides for the research study (there will not be an endometrial biopsy performed for research purposes with the second surgery). The slides from surgery 1 \& surgery 2 will then be compared.

If a clinical correlation is found with the aggressivity panel, the goal would be to create a local lab and tissue bank here in the United States that could provide a basis for collaborative national (even international) research.

Understanding the precise nature of the relationship between pain and endometriosis is important for the clinical management of affected women, given the body of evidence indicating that medical and surgical management for pain associated with endometriosis has been shown to be effective. Evaluating the relationship between pain and endometriosis, however, is challenging given that pain is difficult to measure and the mechanism by which endometriosis causes pain is not well understood.

Several treatment strategies, including surgical ones, are proposed but they are sometimes insufficient because endometriosis-related pain is frequently accompanied by sensitization. Endometriosis surgery, when indicated, is therefore changeably effective, even though the lesions have been completely resected. Patients therefore consult Pain Units seeking for the effective treatment as the pain persist even after surgical management of endometriosis.

Vagus nerve stimulation is a non-invasive technique that includes an anti-inflammatory effect and a modulation of neurotransmitter production (adrenaline, norepinephrine; serotonin, acetylcholine). Yuan and Silberstein published a general review on the technique. Migraine and depression are one of the selected indications.

NCT03142035,Dienogest Versus GnRH-a Pre-treatment in Women With Endometriosis Undergoing IVF,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03142035,,UNKNOWN,"Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic disease that affects approximately 10% of women in the reproductive age group . It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, causing pelvic pain and subfertility. It is estimated that around 40% of infertile women have the diagnosis of endometriosis . Infertility secondary to endometriosis is thought to be multifactorial. Women with endometriosis often require in vitro fertilization (IVF). One medical intervention that has been shown to improve IVF outcomes in women with endometriosis is hormonal suppression with gonadotropic releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) for a period of 3 to 6 months .

In recent years, the effectiveness of dienogest, a fourth-generation progestin, for endometriosis treatment has been demonstrated. Dienogest seems to be as effective as GnRH-a in improving endometriosis-related pelvic pain \[4\]. However, no study has yet assessed whether dienogest has any benefit in treating endometriosis associated infertility.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of dienogest versus GnRH-a in improving ongoing pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF due to endometriosis. We will conduct a non-blinded randomized controlled trial. One group will receive dienogest 2mg daily for a period of 3 months followed by a standard IVF/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) cycle. The second group will receive one injection of 3.75mg of GnRH-a every 28 days for three doses followed by a standard IVF/ICSI cycle 3 months later. The third group will not receive any medical interventions before the planned IVF/ICSI cycle. We hypothesize that patients receiving dienogest will have similar ongoing pregnancy rates compared to patients receiving the GnRH-a injection. Secondary outcomes including number of gonadotropins consumed, number of stimulation days, number of metaphase II eggs retrieved, fertilization rate, embryo quality, miscarriage rate, clinical pregnancy rates, live birth rates and potential maternal and obstetrical complications will also be evaluated.

NCT02669238,Evaluation of a Subcutaneous Progestogen Implants in the Medical Management of Painful Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02669238,END-IMPACT,TERMINATED,"Endometriosis is a chronic relapsing disease characterized by the presence and proliferation of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. This is a serious disease, widespread, difficult to live with for the patients, but also difficult to treat for practitioners who take care of these patients. It affects 1.6% of the general population, but its incidence is 10 times higher (up 40%) in patients with infertility. It occurs mainly by complex chronic pelvic pain and a negative influence on fertility.

It is a disease whose complexity can be explained to four levels. Firstly, through its extremely polymorphic character with intraperitoneal superficial forms, ovarian forms and deep sub-peritoneal forms.

Secondly by the plurality of the main symptoms which are individually non-specific and the frequency and / or intensity is not correlated with the severity of the disease. This non-specificity of symptoms partially explains the long lead misdiagnosis, which vary by 5 to 11 years.

Thirdly, by its prevalence which seems very high and largely underestimated. If its precise estimate in the general population is so complicated, it seems very high in many studies of patients supported surgically for gynecological reasons. These very large prevalence figures are observed when some consultations support the hypothesis of a widespread and probably insufficiently evaluated disease.

Lately by its management, insufficiently amended, for which there is currently only a few scientifically supported recommendations.

NCT01301885,ENDOMET - Novel Diagnostic Tools and Treatments for Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01301885,ENDOMET,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of functional endometrial glands and stroma in ectopic locations outside the uterine cavity. The ectopic endometrial tissue responds to estradiol and other hormones similarly to the normal endometrium. Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecological conditions, as many as 5-10% of women in the reproductive age may be affected. In addition to pain which may be severe, subfertility is one of the typical problems associated with endometriosis and may be present in up to 40% of those affected. There is lack of a clear correlation between severity of pain and degree of compromised fertility. Different modes of treatment exist. Hormonal treatments are based on the suppression of estrogenic action on endometriosis as well as the endometrium. Unfortunately, discontinuation of the hormonal treatment typically results in a rapid recurrence of the disease. Surgery may alleviate the symptom for different lengths of time, however, curative treatment frequently involves hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. In order to escape this radical treatment, new targeted therapy in the form of novel pharmacological agents would be of crucial importance. Presently, endometriosis can be reliably diagnosed only by laparoscopy. Since this is an invasive surgical procedure, new diagnostic tools would be warmly welcomed. Furthermore, as the progression of the disease is presently impossible to predict, new markers for the ""malignancy"" of each case are desperately needed.

The aim of the investigators research is to identify expression of endometriosis specific RNAs/proteins. Evaluation of expression profiles in samples of endometriosis and endometrium of patients with careful clinical and surgical classification of endometriosis as well as healthy control women should initially enable to identify novel targets for new therapies and biomarkers.

NCT01464775,A Comparison of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and Standard White Light Laparoscopy to Detect Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01464775,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is a relatively common chronic gynecological condition that affects approximately 10% of all women of reproductive age. It is a pelvic inflammatory disease that is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity. Typical symptoms of endometriosis include dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility; the severity of pain associated with this disease often leads to a considerable decrease in quality of life.

The standard treatment for severe pelvic pain and infertility is to surgically remove endometriotic areas. Identifying all endometriotic lesions is paramount to ""optimal endometriosis debulking."" The inability to see all endometriosis lesions has been thought to be a factor for patients with little or no relief following surgery. Using the Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) method has the potential to improve visualization of endometriosis lesions, assist in debulking and thus, result in improved clinical outcomes.

NBI is a technique that uses a specific narrow wavelength of light to change the normal color contrasts of the endoscopic image and improve detection of neovascularization, which is the pathological feature of endometriosis for both superficial and deeper vascularization. This type of imaging has the potential to offer improved discrimination of lesions, increasing diagnostic yield as well as resulting in more complete debulking.

This study is designed to determine the degree to which NBI improves the detection and diagnosis of endometriosis lesions. Data collected during the study will be used to test the hypothesis that the use of NBI will improve the detection and diagnosis of endometriotic lesions at the time of laparoscopy compared to standard visible white light examination. Furthermore, this study will also determine the impact of the use of NBI compared to use of white light examination on reported severity of pain at 6-weeks, 3-months, and 6 months following surgery.

Hypotheses:

The use of NBI in addition to white light examination will improve the diagnostic yield of endometriotic lesions at the time of laparoscopy compared to only using white light examination.

The use of NBI in addition to white light examination will improve the sensitivity of detecting endometriotic lesions and reduce false positives at laparoscopy compared to only using white light examination.

Secondarily, the use of NBI will be associated with a greater reduction in pain at the 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up compared to the use of white light examination alone because of improved lesion identification and debulking.",YES,Endometriosis,OTHER: Narrow Band Imaging (NBI)|OTHER: Standard White Light Laparoscopy,"Diagnostic Yield, Diagnostic yield in this study is defined as the number of patients undergoing the surgical procedure who are diagnosed, based on pathology, with endometriosis.

Endometriosis may be treated with medication or surgery, or both. Because uterine tissue grows more when estrogen levels are high, medical treatment is designed to lower estrogen. Decreased estrogen, however, is often associated with weak bones and hot flashes. Also, women with endometriosis may have lower bone density as a consequence of their disease. This study will look at bone density in these women, particularly to see if areas other than the lower back may be affected.

Regularly menstruating women between 40 and 50 years old, with or without a history of endometriosis, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened by telephone; women with endometriosis are asked to provide documentation of their endometriosis before beginning the study.

Study participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Medical history and blood sample collection
* Questionnaires about exercise activity, calcium intake, menstrual cycle history, cigarette use and medication history
* DEXA scan: This test evaluates the strength of the bones in the back, wrist, and hip. The DEXA scanner uses low-energy x-rays to determine bone density.

* A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
* A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.

The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life., Baseline and week 12|Concentration of Serum Estradiol, The concentration of serum estradiol (E2) was quantified using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrophotometry (LC/MS/MS).

NCT05433909,Microbiota and Immunoassay in Women With and Without Endometriosis: a Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05433909,,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. This pathology has a prevalence of about 5-10% in reproductive-aged women. Endometriosis therapy uses two options: surgical or medical (hormonal) but none can be considered completely resolving. Related signs and symptoms include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility, dysuria and dyschezia. In addition to typical gynecological symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting) affect up to 90% of patients with endometriosis. Despite its high prevalence and associated morbidity, its etiology is still unclear and is thought to be multifactorial, and genetic, hormonal, environmental and immunological factors contribute to it. Several studies have shown a significant association between abnormal immune response and maintenance of disease activity in women with endometriosis.

The microbiome contains all the genetic material of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and Archaea, which live inside the host and regulate various physiological functions. The set of these bacteria, fungi, viruses and Archaea is called a microbiota. The influence of the microbiome on immunomodulation and the development of various inflammatory diseases is well established. Conversely, little is known about the presence and composition of the microbiome in the female reproductive system and its role in the development of endometriosis or other gynecological conditions. Considering the altered inflammatory state typical of endometriosis, it seems logical to postulate a potential role of the microbiome in the etiopathogenesis of this pathology. Interestingly, the microbiome affects estrogen metabolism and estrogen affects the gut microbiome.

In case of opening of the bowel a subsequent inflammatory reaction follows the surgery, as demonstrated by the increase in blood levels of C-reactive protein during the first post-operative week. Furthermore it increases the risk of post-operative bowel complications. In case of peritonitis the general surgeons use extensive lavage in order to decreases mortality, morbidity and post-operative adhesions formation, as demonstrated in animal models and clinically in patients with peritonitis.

No strategies to prevent the recurrence of endometriosis have been uniformly successful. Local progesterone treatment of endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for 12 months has resulted in a significant reduction in dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia; a high degree of patient satisfaction; and a significant reduction in the volume of rectovaginal endometriotic nodules. LNG-IUS may become a more important option if a long-term medical suppression of endometriosis.

Based on literature review, I hypothesized that maintenance therapy of LNG-IUS in conjunction with the GnRH agonist could lower the recurrence rates endometriosis after conservative surgery. We try to answer the question whether maintenance therapy of LNG-IUS in conjunction with the GnRH agonist could lower the recurrence rates and thus extend the symptom-free interval (menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea) as compared to GnRH agonist alone after conservative surgery in severe endometriosis cases.",NO,Endometriosis,DEVICE: LNG-IUS|DRUG: GnRH agonist (triptorelin),"Recurrence rate of endometriosis, We will follow the patients for 2 years, after the end of GnRH agonist medical treatment.

NCT06452407,Evaluating the Feasibility of elleFA App Implementation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06452407,elleFA,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a chronic incurable disease where endometrial-like tissue grows outside of the uterus, and causes symptoms such as debilitating menstrual pain, pain during intercourse, infertility, constipation, and bloating, which hurts their quality of life. Endometriosis is estimated to affect approximately 10% of women. Despite this, there's currently not enough research on this disease; in Canada it takes on average 5.4 years to get a diagnosis (from when symptoms start), and once diagnosed, women often have to go through a trial-and-error process to find a treatment that can manage their symptoms. Misunderstanding symptoms and struggling with patient-provider communication both contribute to these delays in diagnosis and finding the best treatment.

Mobile health applications have been a promising new tool to self-track symptoms and treatments. There are several apps currently available on the market for logging chronic pain, menstrual cycles, and fertility. However, no apps exist specifically for endometriosis that look at the whole spectrum of symptoms, including pain, quality of life, and especially ease of patient-provider communication. The elleFA app is a new, personal endometriosis and health tracking app designed to improve patient-physician dialogue through more direct, efficient, and impactful communication, as patients navigate their condition.

This single-arm interventional study aims to test the feasibility of implementing the new elleFA app in a clinical setting for 6 months in pre-menopausal women 18 years and older with endometriosis, and the app's impact on patient experience. Participants will download the elleFA app on their smartphone and will be asked to complete two questionnaires through the app every month for 6 months. Participants can choose to also optionally track their daily symptoms, lifestyle, and treatments, through weekly symptom log summaries through the app.

The main study finding will be be patient adherence to using the app over a 6 month study period. Other findings will include user-reported satisfaction with the elleFA app, and the impact of elleFA app use on patient experience communicating with their healthcare team.",NO,Endometriosis,OTHER: Implementation of elleFA smartphone application,"patient adherence to using the app, Completion rate of monthly modified Biberoglu and Behrman (B\&B) scale and Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30) surveys over a 6 month study period, retrieved electronically., 6-months following trial commencement","Patient reported satisfaction with the app experience, score of patient-reported questionnaire designed to capture the user experience and perceived app functionality using a 6-point Likert scale (from 0 (terrible) to 5 (amazing)).

NCT02165917,Study to Compare Peritoneal Ablation by Excision Only and Excision With the Use of an Adhesion Barrier,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02165917,,UNKNOWN,Endometriosis is a common disease of women in the reproductive age and is an important cause for female infertility. Endometriosis is often associated with the development of adhesions which further compromises the fertility of the affected women. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the pregnancy rate one year after excision of endometriosis and application of GnRH-analogues (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) for 3 month. Half of the patients will receive traditional endometriosis treatment with the excision of the endometriotic lesions only. The other half will additionally receive a gel which can reduce adhesion formation (Hyalobarrier®).

This condition is called endometriosis. Before a treatment is available to all patients, researchers study it in clinical trials to better understand its safety and what happens to it in the body.

BAY2328065 is being developed to help treat women who have endometriosis. Women with endometriosis often have very painful menstrual periods, as well as pain in the pelvic area which is not related to menstrual periods and pain during intercourse. Many women with endometriosis may also have problems becoming pregnant. The trial treatment, BAY2328065, works by blocking a certain protein that causes pain and swelling of the tissue and is thought to play a role in endometriosis.

In this trial, the researchers want to compare what happens to different medicinal forms of BAY2328065 in the body. They also want to learn if eating a meal affects what happens to BAY2328065 in the body.

This trial will include about 32 men and women who are aged 18 to 55. There will be 4 groups of participants in this trial. The participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will be men. The participants in Group 4 will be women. There will be 3 treatment courses to the trial for Groups 1, 2 and 3 and 1 treatment course for Group 4.

During the trial, the participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will stay at the trial site for 15 days (3 times 5 days with times in between during which they stay at home). The participants in Group 4 will stay at the trial site for 16 days continuously. But, the trial will last about 6 weeks for the participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3. The trial will last about 9 weeks for the participants in Group 4.

All of the participants in Groups 1 and 2 will take dose ""2"" of BAY2328065 in all 3 treatment courses. In Group 1, they will take BAY2328065 one time each during the following treatment courses:

* A medicinal form of BAY2328065 without food in treatment course 1, then
* A medicinal form of BAY2328065 differing from the one used in treatment course 1 without food in treatment course 2, then
* The medicinal form of BAY2328065 used in treatment course 1 with food in treatment course 3 The participants in Group 2 will do the same, but they will take each form of BAY2328065 in a different order. Information gathered from Group 1 and 2 will help the researchers learn which form of BAY2328065 will be most suited to give to the participants in Groups 3 and 4.

The participants in Group 3 will take 3 different doses of BAY2328065 with food in each treatment course. They will take one time each during the following treatment courses:

* Single administration of dose ""1"" in treatment course 1, then
* Single administration of dose ""2"" in treatment course 2, then
* Single administration of dose ""3"" in treatment course 3 This will help the researchers learn the safest dose to give to the participants in treatment course 4.

This condition brings an important physical and emotional burden on sufferers and this is why it requires proper and timely medical management. At present there are several first-line drugs available for the management of symptoms and disease control. In the world literature we have reported several studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of different groups of drugs such as oral contraceptives, progestins, GnRH analogues and danazol. Within the available scientific evidence it has been extensively described the benefits of the new progestins Dienogest, demonstrating a favorable safety profile and efficacy along with a significant reduction of the symptoms of the disease by its anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative antiagiogénicas in the endometrial tissue . However, although the therapeutic properties of this drug are known, studies are needed to compare its effectiveness with the effectiveness of other therapeutic agents as oral contraceptives. That is why the main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Dienogest to 2 mg / day compared with a combined oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel + ethinyl estradiol) in the size of the endometriomas diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography in 50 women having diameters less than 4 centimeters of the same, which medical management will be given for one year at the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota.

However, the recurrence after surgery is common.

As repetitive surgery leads to morbidities and ovarian function decrease, recurrence after surgery frustrates both patients and clinicians. In this aspect, medical treatments have been offered after surgery to prevent or delay the recurrence. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is frequently used in women with advanced endometriosis, but the efficacy is rather controversial. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that oral contraceptives (OCs) could reduce or delay endometrioma recurrence, but data are still limited. Consequently, no one type of postoperative medical therapy has been shown to be superior in reducing the recurrence of endometrioma.

The rationale of postoperative medical therapy is that it could eradicate microscopic lesions which were not found and not treated sufficiently during surgery. Therefore, the maintenance of strongly suppressed condition induced by postoperative GnRHa treatment by addition of OCs could be a promising treatment to prevent the recurrence, but it has not been widely investigated.

NCT00155051,Progestin Treatment for Endometrial Stromal Cells in Adenomyosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00155051,,UNKNOWN,"Long term treatment of progestin has been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on endometrial angiogenesis and the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells. As a result, progestin is now widely employed in the treatment of endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, and dysfunction uterine bleeding. In the treatment of adenomyosis, however, the beneficial effect of progestin was limited. It might imply that the behavior of endometrial cells in women with adenomyosis is different from that in women without adenomyosis.

Our previous study revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It may be a compensatory effect in which the NK cytotoxicity is activated in order to wipe out the abnormal endometrial cells that might go out of the eutopic site of endometrium. It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to ""abnormal"" endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. This finding is compatible with previous reports in which eutopic endometrium obtained from women with endometriosis or adenomyosis was found to behave differently from endometrium in unaffected women.

In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis, and then purify the endometrial stromal cells from endometrium. The endometrial stromal cells are cultured for 8 days with the supplement of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol. Quantification of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in endometrial cells, and the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in cultured media will be done with real time RT-PCR and ELISA respectively.

NCT00173212,Proliferation of Endometrial Stromal Cells in Adenomyosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00173212,,UNKNOWN,"Adenomyosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands and stroma that is haphazardly deep within the myometrium. However, the etiology and pathologic mechanism responsible for adenomyosis are not yet very well known. Our previous results revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors on natural killer cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. Our further investigation revealed that in vitro coculture of macrophages and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might further enhance the proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic endometrial implants in adenomyosis.

Abnormal cell proliferation has been generally found in the tumorigenesis, including the formation of endometriosis. Adenomyosis is considered to have a similar pathophysiology with endometriosis, and it must be interesting to examine whether there is abnormal cell proliferation in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to promote proliferation of ESCs via induction of TNF-a and IL-8 expression, whereas IFN-g significantly inhibited ESCs proliferation. Therefore, whether abnormal cell proliferation occurs under the effects of LPS and IFN-g in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis needs further clarification.

Adenomyosis preferentially affects women between the ages of 35 and 50 years, and the symptoms subside gradually after menopause. It is well known that there is a close conjunction between estrogen and adenomyosis. Estradiol (E2) was demonstrated to induce endometrial cell proliferation, whereas medroxyprogesterone (MPA) inhibited endometrial cell proliferation via antagonizing estrogenic effects. Experiments to investigate these steroid effects on ESC proliferation in vitro in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis are of clinical relevance.

In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis, and then purify ESCs from endometrium. ESCs are cultured for 2 days with the supplement of LPS, IFN-gamma, Estradiol, MPA and Estradiol+MPA. Quantification of cell proliferation was done with Cell Proliferation Assay Kit and immunocytochemical detection of Ki-67, in an attempt to examine the cell proliferation of ESCs in women with adenomyosis.",NO,Endometriosis,,,,,National Taiwan University Hospital,,FEMALE,ADULT,,45,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,9461700522|NTUH.95-000357,2005-09,,2006-03,2005-09-15,,2005-09-15,"National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan",

It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. In addition, in vitro coculture of macrophages and endometrial stromal cells (ESC) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might further enhance the proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic endometrial implants in adenomyosis. Besides, another possible mechanism is the abnormal apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis. In endometriosis, apoptotic endometrial cells were found to be decreased, which possibly accounts for the formation of endometriosis. However, there have not been reports investigating the apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis.

In this study, we try to investigate apoptotic ESC with flow cytometry in women with and without adenomyosis.

NCT05496218,Metabolomic Profile in Women With and Without Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05496218,METABOLENDO,UNKNOWN,"The pathogenesis of endometriosis is very complex as several factors, including genetic, environmental and lifestyle-related factors, are involved in the development, progression and maintenance of the disease. In particular, there are emerging evidences that prostaglandin metabolism, chronic inflammatory processes and circulating estrogen levels are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Pelvic pain, in particular dysmenorrhea, is the most typical symptom caused by the production of prostaglandins and pain mediators associated with the peritoneal inflammatory state.

Metabolomics strives to measure all metabolites, such as sugars, amino acids, acylcarnitines, organic acids, and lipids, present in a given biological sample. Thus, metabolomics represents a reflection of phenotypic changes in an organism in response to the presence of a certain disease, genetic changes, and nutritional, toxicological, environmental, and pharmacological influences, providing a means to more accurately capture exogenous exposures and evaluate endogenous biomarkers.

Regarding endometriosis, the targeted metabolomics studies focused mainly on lipids, and the non-targeted studies also identified mainly lipids, amino acids, and intermediary metabolites as the most important variables.

The combinations of metabolomics data together with clinical ones are of utmost importance in endometriosis research. This approach might lead to the construction of models/algorithms useful to better define diagnostic/prognostic characteristics of women who have endometriosis, identify environmental and modifiable risk factors, elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms, and contribute to better tailor medical treatments.

In particular, metabolomics may provide a means to capture exogenous exposures and evaluate endogenous biomarkers more accurately.

The main objective of the present research project is to evaluate potential variations in the plasma metabolomic profile of women affected by endometriosis (as compared with a control group) as a consequence of pathophysiologic alterations associated with this disorder.

Secondary objectives are:

1. to evaluate potential variations in the plasma metabolomic profile of endometriosis patients with different phenotypes of the disease: peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis;
2. to evaluate potential variations in the plasma metabolomic profile of endometriosis patients in relation to the presence of endometriosis-related painful symptoms and/or infertility.

There is strong evidence that endometriosis has a negative impact on women's quality of life, with severe long-term consequences and substantial social costs.

NCT06333353,Is Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effective in Reducing Endometriosis-associated Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06333353,,RECRUITING,"The goal of this research is to improve pain outcomes for the over 500K Canadian women, girls and gender-diverse individuals who are newly diagnosed with endometriosis each year. Chronic pain that persists after interventions for endometriosis is a huge problem. There is some evidence that endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) is, at least to some extent, associated with changes in pain physiology, particularly central sensitization of pain. There is currently no effective evidence-informed intervention that addresses EAP. Yet a recent feasibility trial on a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention demonstrated promising results compared to a sham intervention for reducing pain in a sample with EAP.

The objectives of this trial are:

1. to evaluate the effectiveness of an rTMS intervention for pain reduction among those with recalcitrant post-operative EAP,
2. to inform on the utility of a long (10 session) vs short (5 session) protocol for pain reduction among those with recalcitrant post-operative EAP
3. to determine if any improvements in pain observed 30 days after an rTMS intervention are retained 6 months later
4. to identify physical and psychosocial mediators that impact the successful reduction of pain among patients with EAP treated using rTMS.
5. to describe patients' perceptions of and satisfaction with rTMS as an intervention for EAP.",NO,Endometriosis|Pain,DEVICE: Real RepetitiveTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation 5 sessions|DEVICE: Sham RepetitiveTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation 5 sessions|DEVICE: Real RepetitiveTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation 10 sessions|DEVICE: Sham RepetitiveTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation 10 sessions,"Numeric rating scale (NRS) used to record daily pain over 30 days, Pain intensity, using a numeric rating scale (NRS), will be recorded daily for 30 days prior to trial entry to provide a suitable baseline,

NCT05367258,Umbilical Endometriosis: a Comparison of Medical and Surgical Therapy and Pathogenetic Considerations,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05367258,UMBEND,UNKNOWN,"Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. About 5% of women of reproductive age suffer from the disease.

The pelvis is the most frequent site of endometriotic lesion and the most common pelvic localisations are peritoneal, ovarian, and deep infiltrating endometriosis. However, endometriosis can also localize outside the pelvis, for example involving the umbilicus, omentum, appendix, liver, diaphragm, pleura and lungs, vulva, and surgical scars.

The majority of extrapelvic endometriosis implants are located in the skin, and most of them are of iatrogenic origin, following laparotomy, laparoscopic procedures, and episiotomies; only a minority of cases are of primary origin.

Umbilical endometriosis is a very rare presentation of endometriosis (0.5-1% of cases of extrapelvic endometriosis).

Pathogenetic hypotheses of primary umbilical endometriosis include: hematic or lymphatic dissemination of endometrial cells from the peritoneum to the umbilicus through obliterated umbilical arteries; migration of endometrial cells through the venous or lymphatic circulation; metaplasia of urachus remnant or release of endometrial cells that during labor and delivery may contaminate the umbilical cord emergence. Secondary umbilical endometriosis is probably due to the proliferation and subsequent dissemination of iatrogenically implanted endometrial cells in laparotomy or laparoscopic scars. In 20% of cases, umbilical endometriosis is associated with pelvic endometriosis. In these patients, it is probable that endometriotic cells may migrate from the endometriotic implants to the umbilical site.

This migration process could be favored by fascia defects at the umbilical level. In fact, reports in the literature describe cases of umbilical endometriosis coexisting with umbilical hernia.

The clinical presentation consists of an umbilical nodule of variable color (red, blue, black, flesh-colored), ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 cm.

Pathognomonic symptoms are: bleeding and/or pain in the umbilical site of catamenial type, cutaneous hyperesthesia. Catamenial symptomatology associated with the nodule, which makes the diagnosis easier, is present in only 75% of cases.

In asymptomatic cases the differential diagnosis of the nodule of umbilical endometriosis is more difficult (hernia, hematoma, cyst, dermatological disorders, tumor metastasis).

Instrumental examinations useful for differential diagnosis and definition of nodule size include soft tissue ultrasound, CT scan and MRI.

Definitive diagnosis is only by histologic examination of the tissue. Exploratory laparoscopy is not indicated unless concomitant pelvic endometriosis is suspected.

The recommended treatment of umbilical endometriosis is surgical, consisting of complete removal of the endometriosis nodule, omphalectomy, and subsequent reconstruction of the umbilicus.

Recurrence rates after surgery are around 6% at 12 months in a large Japanese court, with no difference between taking and not taking postoperative hormonal therapy, while they are reduced to almost 0% in case of resection including a large portion of peritoneum.

Medical therapy, on the other hand, alleviates the associated algic symptoms by reducing the size of the nodule.

There are very few data on the efficacy of medical therapy; in a study with a very small number of cases an efficacy of 91.7% with dienogest and 51.1% with estroprogestinic pill is reported. There are no studies comparing medical and surgical therapy for the treatment of umbilical endometriosis.

Radical excision is recommended to avoid local recurrences and to avoid the risk of malignant transformation, although it is extremely rare (only 2 cases reported).

In literature, spontaneous resolution has been described in only one pregnant woman.

To date, few studies have evaluated umbilical endometriosis. Moreover, no study has ever formally compared the long-term efficacy of surgical or medical therapy for umbilical endometriosis.

This is a observational, retrospective/prospective and monocentric study; it is based on the review of medical records and on outpatient follow-up visits of patients in our clinic with umbilical endometriosis from 1990.

NCT05812937,Intraoperative Intraabdominal Ultrasound for Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05812937,,RECRUITING,"The diagnosis of bowel endometriosis lesions is in most cases a combination of anamnesis, clinical exam, transvaginal ultrasound (and/or MRI and/or endorectal sonography) and laparoscopy.

Both the transvaginal ultrasound as well as the MRI have showed a great accuracy with very good sensititivity and specificity regarding the imaging diagnosis of bowel endometriosis.

The conventional laparoscopy contributes to the diagnosis of bowel endometriosis by visualizing the nodules and palpating the deep endometriosis nodule using the instruments, therefor offering the surgeon a haptic feedback by grasping, pushing and rolling the bowel wall and the nodules. Horace Roman and Dan Martin showed that 25% of patients undergoing a conventional laparoscopic segmental bowel resection with a minilaparotomy hat palpable non-visualized endometriosis nodules. These nodules could be directly palpated with the hands because the bowel was exteriorized through the minilaparotomy. The direct palpation of the bowel offers of course a superior haptic feedback compared to the haptic feedback offered by the laparoscopic palpation using the instruments. However this was a direct palpation of only the oral part of the bowel. The aboral part of the bowel caudal to the staple line could not be evaluated by direct palpation. New surgical techniques for the segmental bowel resection with transvaginal/transanal NOSE(natural orifice specimen extraction) have been described in the last years. The novel techniques avoid the minilaparotomy and assure a 100% minimal invasive approach offering better esthetic outcomes.

However in such cases a direct palpation of the bowel wall using the hands in order to identify non- visualizable nodules is not possible as the bowel remains the whole time of the procedure inside of the abdomen. On the other side the robotic-assisted laparoscopy doesn't offer the surgeon a haptic feedback at all. In these cases the surgeon has to rely on the visual aspects of the lesions and therefor ""touch"" the lesions with his eyes - the visual information should replace the haptic feedback. So in the case of a robotic assisted laparoscopic segemental bowel resection with a NOSE it is not possible to palpate the bowel at all - neither with instruments, not with the hands. Other surgical techniques used to excise smaller colorectal nodules are the rectal shaving and the full thickness excision (disc excision) using a circular stapler. In these situations the surgeon has to rely exclusively on the visual information as well on the haptic feedback given by the conventional laparoscopic instruments. In more than 30% of the cases of full thickness rectal resection the resection the margins are infiltrated by the endometriosis nodules. All the above mentioned situations raise the question of the radicallity in terms of healthy resection margins and of multifocal lesions that cannot be visualized and/or palpated.

Although this therapy is effective, it does come with significant menopausal side effects, such as hot flashes, sweating, mood changes, sleep disturbance, altered sex drive, decreased bone density, and vaginal and urinary symptoms.

In short, chemically-induced menopause (menopause triggered by GnRH-a injection) causes the same symptoms of natural menopause, but with a sudden onset in a generally young and active population. Low dose hormone add-back therapy is commonly used to lessen these side effects of GnRH-a use.

There are many menopausal hormone therapies (MHTs) used in menopausal women that can help, but few studies have directly evaluated the different options of treatment for women undergoing chemically-induced menopause. Tibolone is a menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) that stands out as a good option in the management of medical menopause in endometriosis patients because it may give fewer side effects than other alternatives and have a positive effect on mood and libido.

NCT01833013,Infertility and Endometriosis Cohort,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01833013,EndoFertil,UNKNOWN,"Nowadays, one in six couples consults for fertility problems. If the standard examination and tests do not reveal any cause of infertility, the woman may undergo a laparoscopic exploration which reveals endometriosis in more than 50% of cases.

Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue out of the uterine cavity. It is frequent (1 in 10 women) and associated with a high economic burden (22 billion dollars in 2002 in the USA) and important decrease in quality of life. Physiopathological mechanisms and risk factors for endometriosis are not well identified.

A woman with endometriosis is 20 times more at risk of infertility. Fecundity rate of a 25-year-old couple is about 15 to 20% in the general population and only 2 to 10% in case of endometriosis.

There are many manifestations of this disease (infertility, pelvic pain) and the anatomo-clinical correlation is not good. The presently used international classification (American Fertility Society revised in 1985, AFSr) does not predict the chance of pregnancy. New scores such as the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) have been proposed to do so, but need to be validated. Treatment for endometriosis-related infertility is not consensual.

NCT04228692,Percutaneous Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation in Post-operative Voiding Dysfunction After Deep Endometriosis Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04228692,,COMPLETED,"Symptomatic endometriosis can be responsible for urinary problems as well as symptoms of clinical bladder hyperactivity and/or symptoms of bladder pain before or during miction that can persist after bladder voiding. Whereas urinary problems can predate surgery due to the endometrial lesions themselves, the surgery can also have functional consequences for urinary function, specifically when there is trauma (incisions, per-operative coagulation) to the inferior hypogastric nerve fibers and/or to the hypogastric plexus.

The incidence of post-surgery urinary symptoms could be as high as 30%. The incidence of voiding problems and specifically of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction can be observed in 17,5% of cases of patients 1-month post-surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis, and persists in 4,8% of women after 12 months.

The gold standard for treatment of voiding problems consists of self-catheterization, as is the case for all non-obstructive voiding dysfunction symptoms. This procedure considerably impacts quality of life. The proper and complete voiding of the bladder remains essential in order to avoid recurring urinary tract infections and pelvic static disorder.

In the case of persistent dysuria, the use of self-catheterization is necessary in 21% of patients after surgery for deep endometriosis, for an average duration of 85 days. To date, few studies have explored the management of post-operative urinary complications after surgery for deep endometriosis. Pharmaceutical alternatives (alpha-blockers, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines) have not proven effective and sometimes cause side effects. However promising alternative treatments are being developed, specifically the neuromodulation of the sacral root. This procedure has been shown effective in the treatment of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction; however, it remains an invasive treatment that has its load of complications and undesirable side-effects. A recent study reports favorable results for the use of sacral neuromodulation in the case of persistent incomplete voiding following surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis. Some studies have also suggested that percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTN) could also be a treatment alternative. The advantage of this procedure is that it is non-invasive and less constraining. No study has yet evaluated whether PTN could also be used to treat patients with persistent voiding dysfunction following surgery for deep endometriosis.

Our study, conducted in the gynecologic department of Croix ROUSSE Hospital, Lyon (France), evaluates PTN as a new treatment option for post-operative voiding dysfunction in women who suffer from deep endometriosis.

Its pathophysiology is still misunderstood today, but more and more work on this pathology are published. The clinical presentation is generally characterized by the existence of cyclical pelvic pain, with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia.

But, there are a wide variety of symptoms, with different painful sites and different types of pain.

The estimated prevalence of endometriosis is about 10% in women. But the impact of this disease on quality of life and its economic impact is estimated considerable. In a US study, the direct costs associated with endometriosis were estimated at US $ 2.801 per woman. Some studies have focused also to quantify work absenteeism associated with endometriosis.

The etiology of endometriosis is based on the migration of endometrial fragments reaching the pelvis via the tubes and establishing themselves on other sites, thus creating non cyclical uterine pain. Catamenial pace of pain is suggestive of the diagnosis, but with time, the pain tends to be chronic rather than cyclical. The standard diagnosis is based on visualization and histological examination of the lesions.

The wide variety of symptoms of endometriosis often leads to wandering and medical diagnostic delay. A better understanding of this disease by the medical community would allow better management of these patients. Currently, endometriosis remains a misunderstood disease by rheumatologists. However, the initial presentation may mimic rheumatologic symptoms; thus, rheumatologists may face this disease.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of manifestations of endometriosis in a cohort of patients with a recent diagnosis of endometriosis established.

Surgery is also one of the treatment options for endometriosis and adenomyosis, including traditional open or minimally invasive endoscopic ovarian cyst resection, oophorectomy, and lesion resection; adenomyosis surgery includes traditional methods Open abdominal, transvaginal or minimally invasive endoscopic hysterectomy, conservative uterine sparing adenomyomectomy and cytoreduction surgery (partial adenomyomectomy). For endometriosis, the common treatment consensus of obstetricians and gynecologists is to follow the surgical treatment of the lesions and then follow-up medication. For women with adenomyosis, if they have completed the birth, it is recommended to have a total hysterectomy, so that there is no recurrence. The possibility. However, for women who have not completed birth, conservative uterine preservation surgery is performed. According to research statistics, endometriosis or adenomyosis does not receive follow-up medical treatment after completion of surgical treatment, there is a high probability of recurrence, but the side effects caused by drugs will also affect the patient's compliance with medication.The Department of Women's Medicine of the hospital has a wealth of experience in the treatment of endometriosis and adenomyosis.

It is important to include quality of life measurements in evaluating the disease severity and response to any given treatment. The 30-item Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30), derived from in-depth interviews of patients with endometriosis, is currently the most reliable questionnaire for health-related quality of life measurement in women with endometriosis. It includes specific questions addressing the problems faced by patients with endometriosis.

Unfortunately, this widely accepted tool does not have a traditional Chinese version for the measurement of health-related quality of life of endometriosis in Hong Kong. Furthermore, adenomyosis and endometriosis share similar histological and clinical symptomatology, but application of EHP-30 to adenomyosis has never been studied.

The aims of the present study are to translate the EHP-30 English version into traditional Chinese version and to evaluate its psychometric properties in endometriosis and adenomyosis.

It is a heterogeneous disease with three different forms: superficial endometriosis (peritoneal), ovarian endometrioma and deep pelvic endometriosis (subperitoneal).

Surgical management of endometriomas is justified in cases of significant clinical symptoms (like pain), especially in cases of resistance to medical treatment. Currently, laparoscopic cystectomy surgery is the recommended technique to treat ovarian endometrioma. However, it is now well demonstrated that this surgery significantly reduces the ovarian reserve.

Ethanol sclerotherapy is an alternative technique used to treat ovarian endometriomas. Several studies demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of this treatment, particularly in terms of preserving fertility. Regarding these reassuring data, many clinicians changed their practices and propose this technique as a first-line surgery.

Ovarian reserve comprises two elements: size of the primordial follicle stock and quality of the ovocytes. Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) has been shown to be the best marker of fertility.

NCT01826500,VARITI-5 : Study of Variations of Serum ITIH5 in Women During the Genital Life and in Pathological Situations,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01826500,VARITI-5,COMPLETED,"The five proteins of the ITI (Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor) family, are essential components of the extracellular matrix, the dynamics of which they participate in the processes of cellular differentiation and proliferation. I. The ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 and ITIH4 genes seem to be overwhelmingly expressed in the liver, this organ secreting then the corresponding proteins in the general circulation. The only data on ITIH5 indicate that this gene is poorly expressed in the liver and that the major source of its expression is the placenta. In the context of genetic studies on the syndrome of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (congenital aplasia of the uterus and vagina), the investigators have shown the involvement of ITIH5 and implemented validation experiments of this gene in mice. The investigators have shown that the production of ITIH5 by the uterus varies greatly depending on the physiological state of this organ, especially during pregnancy and the estrous cycle. The investigators also found that most of the production ITIH5 was located in the uterus. Therefore, the serum dosage of ITIH5 could be used clinically as a new biological marker specific to the uterus. This non-invasive biological marker could thus assist in the diagnosis and the understanding of uterine pathologies. ITIH5 rate being correlated to endometrial proliferation, its dosage could be an early and non-invasive marker of endometriosis. The peak of production of ITIH5 by the uterus at the time of embryo implantation window indicates that the assay could provide a better assessment of endometrial receptivity to embryo. It then could be a hand tool of diagnosis in some cases of early repeated miscarriages, and secondly, a prognostic tool for embryo implantation in the context of in vitro fertilization.

The investigators conducted an initial feasibility study on the serum dosage of ITIH5, which was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Rennes. This first step has been validated.

NCT06579040,The HEROES Trial: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Endometriosis-Related Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06579040,HEROES,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis, is a condition where tissue from the uterus, called endometrium, grows outside of the uterus. This effects up to 10% of women, and can lead to long-lasting, moderate to severe pelvic pain, infertility and other symptoms. This can affect a woman's quality of life (including increased risk of depression and anxiety) and is associated with increased healthcare costs.

Current treatments are often limited by serious side effects, and many women resort to surgery. Surgery is also associated with complications and there are long wait times for procedures, sometimes over 3 years. This means that many women continue to suffer from symptoms while they wait for surgery. Therefore, new effective treatments for endometriosis pain are needed.

New research suggests that inflammation and stress caused by lack of oxygen in the affected areas may cause endometriosis. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), where patients are placed in a small chamber with higher than normal levels of oxygen, suppresses inflammation and promotes tissue healing. Because inflammation is central to this condition, HBOT has emerged as a potential treatment.

NCT05019612,The Role of Expectations on Complaints and Well-being After Endometriosis Surgery in Women,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05019612,ROXWELL,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a prevalent disease in women of procreative age. Most endometriosis patients are affected in their daily life by complaints such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility, or pain during sexual intercourse. Yet, its etiology is poorly understood. Although laparoscopy is well known as the gold standard for treating endometriosis, 20-30% of treated women still show persistent complaints following successful laparoscopy.

It has been widely recognized that expectations profoundly affect treatment courses and outcomes in many different health conditions. Additionally, evidence suggests that optimizing preoperative expectations can improve post-operative outcomes such as disability and return to work.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether expectations also affect treatment course and outcome in women after endometriosis surgery. For this purpose, the investigators conduct a mixed-method observational cohort study to gather data on psychological factors, particularly treatment and symptom-related expectations, as well as complaints and well-being of patients after surgery. A sample of N = 300 women will be asked pre- and postoperatively to evaluate these psychological factors and indicators of treatment course and outcome. Overall, the study will last 12 months, including one assessment preoperatively (baseline), seven monthly assessments postoperatively, and a follow-up assessment 12 months after endometriosis surgery.

The study aims to determine potential interactions between aforementioned psychological factors, their influence on the postoperative health, and the long- and short-term symptom course of patients with endometriosis. The study results will provide a better understanding of the symptom- and treatment course in women with endometriosis and subsequently supply clinical approaches to optimize treatment of endometriosis.",NO,Endometriosis|Expectations|Laparoscopy,PROCEDURE: Laparoscopy: A minimal invasive surgery,"Course of Endometriosis related Pain Disability - Pain Disability Index (PDI-D), The PDI-D assesses the self-reported disability by endometriosis symptoms using a numeric rating scale with eleven response options (0-10).

Despite intensive research in the field of etiopathogenesis, its cause has not yet been determined, and treatment remains symptomatic. Endometriosis causes two main complications, i.e. pelvic pain syndrome and infertility. In recent years, thanks to the analysis of the human microbiome, it has become possible to deepen the knowledge of the physiological and pathological interactions between microorganisms inhabiting various body areas and the host. Bacteria may enter the peritoneal cavity in the mechanism of retrograde menstruation and translocate from the intestines, and then promote the development of local and systemic inflammation, leading to the symptoms of endometriosis. The study is to determine whether the presence of a specific intestinal, peritoneal and uterine microbiome correlates with endometriosis stage and whether its presence predisposes to increased pain or infertility.

NCT04081532,The Effectiveness of Laparoscopic Treatment of Superficial Endometriosis for Managing Chronic Pelvic Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04081532,ESPriT1,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is a chronic, incurable condition that affects about 10% of women of reproductive age. It is defined as a growth of cells similar to the womb lining outside of the womb in the pelvis, and is associated with chronic pelvic pain, excessive period pain, pain with sexual intercourse and difficulties in getting pregnant. If the disease is found only on the lining of the pelvis it is known as ""superficial peritoneal"" and is usually treated during a laparoscopic surgery by cutting out (excision) or burning off (ablation). However, many women do not find improvement in their symptoms after the surgery and can have complications from the procedure. The aim of this study is to determine if removal of the superficial peritoneal endometriosis improves pain symptoms and quality of life, which method of removal (excision or ablation) is more effective or if surgical removal is of no benefit to the patients and can potentially cause harm. The investigators plan to recruit up to 90 women from four NHS hospitals in Scotland over a period of 12 months. Women who are attending gynaecology departments with pelvic pain who have not previously had a diagnosis of endometriosis via laparoscopy will be approached.

NCT04671004,"The ""Concept"" of Parametria in the Treatment of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04671004,,UNKNOWN,"Background Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is most commonly located at the uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, pararectal space and vesicouterine fold. A nodule within the uterosacral ligaments (i.e involvement of the dorsal parametrium), increases the complexity of surgical resection. Parametrial involvement in DIE cases occurs in 25% of patients with severe endometriosis, possibly with hypogastric/sacral plexus or sciatic nerve involvement. The bladder functional impairment, after surgery for DIE involved the parametria, may vary between the 6.5% to 32.8%. Preservation of the hypogastric and pelvic splanchnic nerves represents the key aspect in pelvic surgery to prevent postoperative voiding disfunction. Several techniques for the excision of DIE have been described, but large, prospective RCTs are lacking. In particular, a clear standardization of the parametrectomy for DIE is missing. Systematic reviews on the surgical treatment of DIE demonstrated that it is impossible to compare the literature about the parametrectomy for DIE, because to unclear definitions and lack of standardization. We therefore believe it is necessary to propose a standardization of the definition of parametrectomy performed during procedures for DIE, to allow a clear comparison in the future between scientific works on surgical treatment of DIE, as already widely accepted in gynaecologic oncology with the classification of radical hysterectomy of Querleu-Morrow. In particular we believe that the parametrectomy for DIE must be described based on its anatomical extension and focused on the concepts of nerve sparing dissection, and vascular structures preservation, to reduce the risk of complications due to ischemia (i.e. ureter fistula).

Rationale A standardized description of the procedure (parametrectomy) will allow the comparison between the different techniques in terms of functionality preservation of the pelvic sympathetic and parasympathetic neural pathway. Therefore, the availability of a clear classification able to define parametria involvement during surgery would be clinically relevant, as they would allow to optimize counselling (risk of neurological consequences) and surgery planning.

Type of the study Multicentric prospective observational study. Primary objective To determinate the incidence of bladder functional impairment, after surgery for DIE involved the parametria.

Secondary objectives To classify the parametrectomy into a clear system of classification, based on anatomical landmark, and evaluate intra/postoperative complication to each classes of proposed parametrectomy.

Sample size The sample size has been calculated on the basis of the primary objective; in order to detect a proportion of bladder functional impairment of 30%, with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 9%, a sample of N=100 patients is required.

NCT05418751,Effectiveness of a Manual Therapy Protocol on Women With Pelvic Pain Due to Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05418751,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is a debilitating disease with features of chronic inflammation that affects 10-15% of women of reproductive age. Pelvic pain is one of the most common symptoms in women with endometriosis, and many of them report that it affects their quality of life. In addition, women with endometriosis, especially those with pelvic pain, also have an increased vulnerability to various psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

In this context, physical therapy can contribute to the multidisciplinary assessment and treatment of pelvic pain. In addition, manual therapy could improve certain variables related to central sensitization, such as inhibitory pain regulation and neuronal excitability in the dorsal horn of the medulla, in patients with chronic pain. Some prospective studies have applied manual therapy in patients with pelvic pain due to endometriosis, and have shown a trend towards improvement of pain and quality of life. Moreover, it is considered a well-tolerated and accepted treatment by patients.

However, to date, it has not been investigated whether the application of a manual therapy protocol improves pelvic pain and other endometriosis-associated symptoms, lumbar mobility, medication intake, depression and anxiety levels, and quality of life in women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain compared to a placebo treatment.",NO,Endometriosis|Pelvic Pain,OTHER: Manual therapy|OTHER: Placebo treatment,"Endometriosis symptoms.

NCT03779256,Bowel ENDOmetriosis; Evaluation of Diagnostics and Quality of Life,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03779256,ENDO,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis on the bowel is a benign condition that can cause major complaints and severely affect the quality of life of women of fertile age. If medical treatment is not enough to improve pain and/or other symptoms it may be necessary to undergo major surgical treatment and removal of the endometriosis nodule on the bowel. Such extensive surgical treatment carries risks of serious complications. Therefore, a thorough diagnostic work-up before surgery is important to know the extent of disease. This will provide women with the best possible information and for the surgeon to plan the operation. The risk of complications increases as the bowel endometriosis is localized closer to the anus as well and/or if the bowel nodule is large.

The distance between the anus and the nodule and the size of the nodule can be measured with two dimensional (2D) vaginal ultrasound. Additionally, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used in some countries for these same measurements. Our study would like to investigate the diagnostic value of 2D ultrasound and MRI as well as learn more about women's quality of life before and after surgery. The investigators have designed the study to evaluate the following three questions into three studies ENDO1, ENDO2 and ENDO3:

* ENDO1: How good is 2D transvaginal ultrasound at measuring the size of the bowel endometriosis nodule and the distance between anus and the lower part of the bowel nodule compared to measurements done during surgery?
* ENDO2: What is the quality of life, sexual and bowel function of women before and 3- and 12-months after surgery due to bowel endometriosis? Questionnaires will be used.

NCT02238678,Impact of Deep Endometriosis Surgery on Bladder Function,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02238678,,UNKNOWN,"It has been demonstrated that ligaments, both cardinal and uterosacral contain a considerable amount of autonomic nerve tissues. The resection of deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules at the level of the uterosacral ligaments or the rectovaginal space is supposed to damage the supplying autonomic nerve fibers of the lower urinary tract. The bladder receives motor and sensitive innervations from both the sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and the parasympathetic fibers, which arise from the pelvic splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus; therefore, even bladder function may be impaired in women affected by deep endometriosis.

Very few data have been published regarding the urodynamic functional evaluation of bladder in patient with deep endometriosis.So far, it is unknown if the surgery itself causes the postoperative bladder dysfunction or if the surgery unmasks a subclinically pre-existing detrusor pathology.

Since the urinary postoperative complications have a strong impact on quality of life of the deep endometriosis patients and often requires management (due to a poor spontaneous remission), it is crucial a better understanding of the problem. That will help for a more appropriate pre-operative counselling.

Aims of this study are to evaluate the bladder function before and after deep endometriosis surgery, using standardized validated instruments and to correlate the localisation of the endometriosis lesion, the type/area of surgical dissection with the postoperative bladder function.

This is a prospective multicenter cohort study involving the Department of General Gynaecology and Gynecological Oncology of Medical University of Vienna (Austria) and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Insubria University, Varese (Italy).

A total of 50 patients are planned to be included. The study protocol consider a Preoperative Assessment (clinical examination, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, preoperative specific questionnaire including obstetric, medical, and surgical history and standardized questions on pelvic floor dysfunctions, standardized instrumental assessment of the pelvic floor) a Intraoperative Assessment (during laparoscopy, the localizations of endometriotic lesions recorded and identified by anatomical sites, numbers, and depth of infiltration).

NCT03555903,Quality of Life and Fertility of Patient With Deep Surgical Endometriosis: a Prospective Cohort,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03555903,ENDORAA,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a common gynaecologic disease affecting 5 to 15% women of reproductive age and up to 40% of infertile women. It is characterized by the presence of active endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, potentially causing invalidating chronic pelvic pain and infertility. It is therefore crucial to limit the progression and/or recurrence of the disease, and to improve the quality of life of affected women.

Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), an advanced form of the disease, is defined by the invasion of an anatomical structure and organ close to the uterus (i.e. uterosacral ligament, rectovaginal space, recto-sigmoidal colon or bladder), or by a peritoneal invasion greater than 5mm. The management of DIE is unfortunately not yet based on high-level evidence data; it mainly depends on the localization of the disease, the extend of the invasion and the severity of the symptoms. In the absence of clear guidelines based on empirical data, the choice between surgical or medical treatment remains difficult and controversial.

To improve optimal DIE management, the investigators aim to create a prospective database reporting on DIE surgically treated in a teaching hospital in Lyon/France (Centre hospitalier universitaire Lyon Sud)

Data on known risks factors, symptoms (pain), quality of life, infertility history and disease management will be obtained using self-questionnaires, clinic, paraclinic, surgical and histological records as follow.

1. Each patient will be asked to fill in electronics protected on-line forms: the first one before surgery, followed by three follow-up forms at 1, 2 and 5 years after surgery.
2. The surgeon will be asked to fill in two electronic protected on-line forms: the first one at the time of surgery and the second one during a post-operative consultation (one month after surgery).

The questionnaires used in this study are similar to those used for the Endometriosis database ""CIRENDO"" (explain briefly what it is), which will ultimately allow us to pool the data from the 2 databases.

NCT05899088,Mindful Movement for Pelvic Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05899088,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as the sensation of pain arising from the lower urinary tract, bowel, muscles, nerves, and gynecologic organs within the pelvis. It can also include menstrual pain and pain with intercourse, when these adversely affects a patient's well-being. Chronic pelvic pain is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual and emotional consequences, which can include physical deconditioning, pain catastrophizing (magnifying the threat of pain), kinesiophobia (fear of movement), and depression. CPP has been estimated to affect between 5.7%-26.6% of women.Treatments for chronic pelvic pain are limited, and the use of centrally acting pain medications such as opioids is common. There is increasing awareness of the risks of these medications, including dependence, addiction, and over-dose related death. Therefore, it is critical to look for safe alternatives to manage chronic pelvic pain.

Exercise has been targeted as a treatment strategy for chronic pain conditions, improving both pain intensity and physical function. Studies have demonstrated that yoga, Zumba®, and treadmill walking can improve menstrual related pain and quality of life. Mindfulness is the non-judgmental acceptance and investigation of present experience, including body sensations, internal mental states, thoughts, emotions, impulses, and memories to reduce suffering or distress and to increase well-being. Prior research by our group has demonstrated efficacy of mindfulness meditation in reducing pain and improving quality of life in women with chronic pelvic pain. Mindful movement is putting attention into what the body is feeling as it moves. It involves paying attention movement that feels good as well as to early warning signs that an exercise may be too intense or may cause a pain flare.

This study is a 12-week program of gentle aerobic exercise and stretching for patients with CPP that applies mindful movement practices.

NCT00001848,The Safety and Effectiveness of Surgery With or Without Raloxifene for the Treatment of Pelvic Pain Caused by Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001848,,COMPLETED,"Many women with lower abdominal pain have endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The treatment of endometriosis includes medical and surgical approaches alone or in combination. The hormone estrogen stimulates the growth of the endometrium and may also stimulate the growth of endometriosis. Medical therapies that act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.

Surgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.

This study was developed to see if surgery followed by daily doses of Raloxifene (Evista) is effective in reducing pain, for a longer time than surgery in combination with a placebo (inactive ""sugar pill"") treatment. Raloxifene acts like estrogens in some tissues and not like estrogens in others. Postmenopausal women receiving Raloxifene for the prevention of osteoporosis had an increase in bone density and an improvement of their blood lipids (fat content in the blood). However, unlike estrogen, Raloxifene does not promote the growth of breast tissue or the uterus. If Raloxifene blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) of reproductive age women, as it does in post-menopausal women, it may also limit the growth of endometriosis and prevent the return of pain.",NO,Endometriosis|Pelvic Pain,DRUG: Raloxifene,,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD),,FEMALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,612,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,990012|99-CH-0012,1998-11,,2006-01,1999-11-04,,2016-09-22,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

However, studies on the psychological and social consequences of endometriosis are scarce, none has investigated life-partners' view of the disease and its consequences, and all adopt cross-sectional designs.

Research highlights the beneficial effects of adapted physical activity (APA), on chronic diseases. Thus, APA may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms and the psychological and social consequences of endometriosis. However, studies questioning the link between PA and endometriosis are rare. The scarcity of studies can be explained by the fact that due to the painful symptoms caused by the disease; women avoid practicing. It is worth noticing that, in the specific context of endometriosis, the barriers and facilitators to PA are not clearly identified. Otherwise, due to their cross-sectional design, it is not possible for these studies to establish a causal link between PA and endometriosis. A RCT is needed to test the effects of PA on endometriosis and its consequences.

The investigators' ambition is to fill these gaps in the existing literature and to allow a more comprehensive view of the phenomena at play in the relation between PA and endometriosis. To this end, the investigators will seek to achieve 2 objectives:

1. to identify the perceived effects of the disease on different areas of patients' lives, specifically areas related to PA, and to examine the reasons why patients are or are not physically active using a mixed methodology. Life-partners and women who do not suffer from this disease will also be involved in this study.
2. to investigate the effects of an APA program which includes therapeutic patient education (TPE) on 3 primary outcomes: perceived pain, QoL, and PA. A complementary aim is to determine the effect of the program on psychosocial and motivational variables, and on physiological variables.

NCT06732050,Influence of Intraoperative Nociception Guided Analgesia on Perioperative Total Analgesic Requirement Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06732050,ENDONOL,RECRUITING,"Adequate analgesia in the perioperative setting is one of the most important pillars of anesthesiology. It is generally understood that poorly managed acute postoperative pain correlates with increased morbidity, prolonged recovery periods, extended opioid utilization, and serves as a predictor for chronic pain onset . On the other hand, the overuse of opioid-based analgesics during surgery may evoke respiratory depression, constipation, nausea, sedation, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia . Thus far, the lack of an objective intraoperative pain monitor has constrained anesthesia practitioners to rely on the interpretation of physiological cues such as tachycardia, hypertonia, and lacrimation as surrogate markers of pain (3). Variability in the educational background and clinical experience among providers may predispose to either excessive or inadequate administration of analgesics, consequently allowing for unfavorable postoperative outcomes. However, recent advancements have introduced novel devices for nociception measurement. Thus, a quantifiable assessment of nociception has become feasible. The most widely approved device is the Nociception Level (NOL®) index developed by Medasense in Israel. This index operates by discerning various sympathetic responses of the body to nociceptive stimuli and has been thoroughly tested on opioid-based analgesic regimens. The NOL® index uses a multiparametric approach including a random forest algorithm to measure the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic system activity. Recently, a strong correlation has been reported between the response of the NOL® index and analgesia during surgery.

There are 4 stages in endometriosis according to severity, and the stage is established on the basis of intra-operative observations. The AFSr classification is currently most used (I-IV,minimal, mild, moderate, severe). Most associated with endometriosis are subfertility and pelvic pain.

In the surgical management of deep endometriosis, the issue of fertility is pivotal. There is a higher rate of infertility in a population of women with endometriosis as compared to the general population, even though the mechanisms are not yet elucidated. Patients with deep endometriosis can be referred to the surgeon for subfertility, but even when they are referred for chronic pain, future fertility considerations are taken into account in the planning of the surgery, as the patients are often young.

It is now well documented that ovarian cystectomy is deleterious with regards to the ovarian reserve, and more so in endometriomas than in any other type of benign cysts. The ovarian reserve is the functional potential of the ovaries, reflecting the quantity and quality of remaining follicles. Studies have also relied greatly on the measure of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) to evaluate the effect of cystectomy on ovarian reserve, as AMH is currently the most reliable marker to assess ovarian reserve. A significant difference was found between AMH before and following cystectomy in several studies. The deleterious effect of deep endometriosis surgery which comprises a wide dissection and adhesiolysis of the pelvis in many cases, even when no cystectomy has been performed, is therefore not entirely ruled out. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the effect of deep endometriosis surgery, apart from ovarian surgery, on ovarian reserve.

In women with endometriosis, the tissue that normally covers the inside of the womb grows outside the womb. This can cause pain during their periods or during sex, and constant pain in the pelvis. Endometriosis can decrease a woman's quality of life. It also requires long-term treatment to control the symptoms.

The study drug, dienogest, has already been approved as a treatment for endometriosis associated pelvic pain. Sometimes, researchers continue studying a treatment after it has been approved to learn more about its safety.

In this study, the researchers want to learn more about any medical problems the patients have while taking dienogest. To answer this question, the researchers will collect the medical problems the patients have after taking dienogest and that may or may not be related to dienogest. These medical problems are also known as adverse events.

They will also collect information about the endometriosis associated pelvic pain. The pain measured with a standard rating scale called EAPP (endometriosis-associated pelvic pain) before treatment start and after 6 months of treatment will be compared.

The trial will include women with endometriosis associated pelvic pain whose doctors have decided to start treating them with dienogest. It will include about 160 women in India who are at least 18 years old.

All of the patients will take dienogest based on their doctor's instructions. They will then visit their study site 3 times over 6 months. At these visits, their doctors will ask them questions about how they are feeling and what medications they are taking.

In women with endometriosis, uterine tissue grows outside the uterus. Standard treatments - altering hormone levels to prevent endometrial tissue growth or surgically removing endometrial tissue - treat pelvic pain only temporarily. This study will investigate the role of sex hormones, immune chemicals, stress hormones, and genes in pelvic pain and determine how the nerve, muscle, and skeletal systems are involved in this pain.

Women between 18 and 50 years of age who:

1. have endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain, and
2. have chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis, and
3. have neither endometriosis nor chronic pelvic pain and are willing to have a tubal ligation (Healthy Volunteer group),

may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a questionnaire to obtain information about their pain and previous treatments and related medical or social issues. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

1. Medical history and physical examination, including pelvic exam, blood tests, urinalysis, and diaphragm fitting.
2. Questionnaires about pain, quality of life, sexuality, psychological attitudes, spiritual experiences, and history of headache and depression.
3. At-home monitoring for 4 to 6 weeks of pain symptoms, menstruation and spotting, medicines taken, and urine collections to test for ""LH"" surge. LH is the hormone that causes the ovary to release a mature egg.
4. Pre-laparoscopy evaluation to include:

   * Examination of menstrual blood collected in a diaphragm for 4 hours.
   * Blood sampling to measure adrenal and pituitary hormones. For this test, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is injected through an IV needle. Up to five blood samples are drawn, starting before the injection until 45 minutes after it. Blood is also collected at this time for genetic analysis.
   * In-depth pain assessment to identify trigger points in muscles associated with pelvic pain, regions of skin sensitivity, and bone pain. Some women will undergo microdialysis, which uses an acupuncture-type needle to collect chemicals from two different muscles.
   * Blood sampling twice a week for 1 month to measure changes in blood substances during the menstrual cycle.
   * Blood sampling after the LH surge to measure progesterone levels.
   * Cervicovaginal lavage (washing of the cervix with saline and collecting the fluid) to obtain secretions for research.
   * Ultrasound of the ovaries and uterus. This examination uses a probe inserted into the vagina that emits sound waves that are used to form pictures of the internal structures. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.
   * A visit with the members of the Pain and Palliative care service to evaluate the pain in anticipation of offering other treatments for pain after surgery.
   * Surgery:

CPP + Endo or CPP only: Laparoscopy to look for and remove endometrial tissue. This procedure is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is passed through an incision in the belly button to look for endometriosis. If it is found, two or more incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to remove the tissue. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.

Healthy Volunteers: Laparoscopy to perform the tubal ligation. A tubal ligation, commonly known as ""getting your tubes tied,"" is a surgical procedure for women to sterilize them. This procedure closes the fallopian tubes, stopping the egg from traveling from the ovary to the uterus and preventing sperm from reaching the fallopian tube to fertilize an egg. In a tubal ligation, fallopian tubes are cut, burned, or blocked with rings, bands or clips. The surgery is effective immediately. Tubal ligations are 99.5% effective as birth control. This procedure is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is passed through an incision in the belly button to perform a tubal ligation. Two or more incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to perform the procedure. During the laparoscopy, we will look for and remove endometrial tissue. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.

NCT05357924,Evaluating Ovarian Reserve After Conventional Laparoscopy Versus Robotic Surgery for Bilateral Endometrioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05357924,,UNKNOWN,"The aim of this study is to perform a randomized study investigating AMH recovery comparing robot-assisted laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy in patients with bilateral ovarian endometrioma. It is hypothesized that in patients with endometriomas, a robot-assisted approach may provide improved instrument navigation resulting in more precise dissection and therefore removal of less healthy ovarian tissue compared to conventional laparoscopy. AMH is the most widely used parameter for predicting functional ovarian reserve. Postoperative AMH levels were associated with the number of follicles in specimens due to the removal of ovarian cortex during surgery . Furthermore, the reduction in AMH level after surgery is higher in bilateral endometrioma.

The investigators hypothesize, on the basis of Lee at al., 2020, that patients with bilateral endometrioma will have significantly higher AMH levels 6 months after robot-assisted laparoscopy than patients who were treated with conventional laparoscopy.

Therefore, the primary outcome is postoperative serum AMH level recovery in patients undergoing conventional laparoscopy versus robot-assisted laparoscopy.

Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate postoperative differences in ovarian reserve differing between robot-assisted laparoscopy compared to conventional laparoscopy in patients with bilaterial ovarian endometrioma by comparing serum AMH (sAMH) level recovery.

Study population: The study population will consist of women aged between 18 and 45 years who are referred to our gynecologic outpatient clinic due to bilateral endometrioma. Women with an indication for surgery can be included in this trial.

Methods: Laparoscopic-assisted resection of endometriosis will be performed using up to four 5-mm ports, including an umbilical port and additional ports as dictated by each individual surgery. The robotic-assisted resection of endometriosis will be performed using the da Vinci Surgical System Si (Intuitive Surgical) using up to five ports as needed.

NCT04448366,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04448366,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged women and causes severe pain and impaired quality of life (QoL). Surgery for endometriosis results in long term symptom relief in only 40% of women.

QoL in endometriosis improves after surgery, but not to the level of healthy women. Mediators in QoL include pain intensity, pain cognitions, and stress. In a preliminary study, patients with negative pain cognitions reported higher pain intensities compared to patients with positive pain cognitions. This indicates that psychological factors explain considerable variance in pain, suggesting that changing these factors by psychological interventions may contribute to improving QoL. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is proven effective as a psychological treatment for pain-related symptoms. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether usual care combined with CBT improves QoL in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis compared to usual care only. Secondary objectives are to investigate whether pain intensity, pain cognitions, perceived stress, fatigue and objectively measured cortisol levels mediate the effects of CBT on QoL in both groups.

In a randomized controlled trial, 100 endometriosis patients undergoing surgery will be randomized between usual care with CBT (CBT group) and usual care only (control group). Women in the CBT group will receive, in addition to usual care, one pre-surgery and six post-surgery sessions of CBT, aimed at positively influencing mediators of QoL. Women in the control group will receive only usual care. Follow-up will be 7,5 months. In both groups QoL, pain intensity, pain cognitions, fatigue, perceived stress (using questionnaires) and objective stress (assessing cortisol in a hair sample) will be assessed at baseline assessment, T1 (two weeks after completion of all CBT sessions) and T2 (follow-up).

The modular questionnaire is composed of 23 items grouped into 6 scales: work life (5 items), relationship with children (2 items), sexual inter- course (5 items), medical profession (4 items), treatment (3 items), and infertility (4 items). The modular question- naire is characterized by the possibility of responding only to scales which the patient deems relevant to her. All scales can achieve a minimum score of 0, indicating low disabil- ity, and a maximum score of 100, indicating high disabil- ity.

The raw scale score is computed as a simple algebraic sum of the recoded item values. The raw scale score is then transformed to a 0-100 scale. Norm-based scores may be calculated for SF-36v2 by including population normative data in the scoring algorithms. The BPS score is only calculated if both items are completed.

Score interpretation. SF-36v1 BPS scores range from 0-100. A higher score indicates lack of bodily pain. SF-36v2 uses norm-based scoring, where 50 is the ""average"" for the population. Therefore, scores above or below 50 can be considered above or below, respectively, the population average health status for bodily pain, and scores can be interpreted based on deviance from the mean (10 points = 1 SD).

Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in postsurgical patients ( hysterectomy, or laparoscopic myomectomy) who described their postoperative pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm), Cases were administered and fulfilled the questionnaires at the moment of diagnosis of endometriosis up to 4 weeks|Biberoglu and Behrman scale, The Biberoglu and Behrman scale consists of three patient-reported symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain not related to menses) and two signs assessed during pelvic examination (pelvic tenderness and induration).

NCT06495151,Endometriosis and Complement System,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06495151,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological condition affecting nearly 10% of women of reproductive age.

Adhesions can lead to chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, digestive disorders and infertility. Various strategies and devices have been developed to try and limit adhesion formation, but their effectiveness has not been fully proven in the literature. The only real treatment for adhesions is adhesiolysis, although adhesions often reform. The quality of surgery remains the best means of preventing adhesion formation.

NCT05161949,Artificial inTelligence in eNdometriosis-related ovArian Cancer and Precision Surgery in eNdometriosis-related ovArian Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05161949,ATENA,UNKNOWN,"Endometriosis (EMS) is a chronic, invaliding, inflammatory gynaecological condition affecting 10-15% of women in reproductive age. EMS is characterized by lesions of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus involving pelvic peritoneum and ovaries. In addition, distant foci are sometimes observed. Unfortunately, the aetiology of the EMS is little known. Although non-malignant, EMS shares similar features with cancer, such as development of local and distant foci, resistance to apoptosis and invasion of other tissues with subsequent damage to the target organs. Moreover, patients with EMS (particularly ovarian EMS) showed high risk (about 3 to 10 times) of developing epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Epidemiologic, morphological and molecular studies reported endometrioma as the precursor of EOC, including clear cell (CCC) endometrioid carcinoma which are both called ""EMS-related ovarian carcinoma (EROC)"". To date, it remains unclear why benign EMS causes malignant transformation. This multi-step process, unlike high-grade serous carcinomas, offers the possibility to identify the carcinoma precursors enabling an early diagnosis and in the early stages of the disease.

EOC is the most lethal female gynecological cancer with 25% 5-year overall survival (OS), due to the lack of effective screening tools, and rapidly spreads over the entire peritoneal surface (carcinosis) thus involving all abdominal organs. Diagnosis and clinical staging of EOC is currently performed by qualitative image evaluation although the sensitivity/specificity is suboptimal. To date, diagnostic, staging, and prognostic factors are strongly correlated with subjective assessment training and clinician experience.

Genomic analysis based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revealed the presence of cancer-associated gene mutations in EMS. Moreover, the chronic inflammatory process of EMS involves many factors, such as hormones, cytokines, glycoproteins, and angiogenic factors, which are expected to become early EMS biomarkers.

A promising new branch of cancer research is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize new image patterns and texture and/or detecting novel biomarkers to improve the early identification of EROC patients. AI has never been used for EROC and we want to investigate whether these methods/techniques can support and even improve current diagnostics and risk assessment.

NCT06289257,Association of Vitamin D Level and Its Receptor with Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06289257,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis, a condition where endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus, often occurs due to retrograde menstruation, where menstrual blood flows backward through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity. This tissue can then implant and grow within the pelvic peritoneum. The survival of these ectopic implants leads to chronic inflammation, adhesion formation, and scarring of surrounding tissues, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Symptoms include cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility.

Ectopic endometrial tissue survival is not attributed to mutations but rather epigenetic changes. Studies have linked this phenomenon to genes such as KRAS (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene), involved in cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulated KRAS activity can lead to increased production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins, implicated in angiogenesis and tissue invasion, facilitating the spread of endometrial tissue.

Vitamin D has been shown to modulate immune function and reduce inflammation. Studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate endometriosis symptoms and severity. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in managing endometriosis symptoms is mixed.

One study found that long-term intake of vitamin D-rich foods was associated with an 18% lower risk of developing endometriosis. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency has been correlated with increased expression of mutated KRAS in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting a potential link between vitamin D status and genetic abnormalities in disease progression.

Clinical presentation of endometriosis can vary widely, often significantly reducing quality of life, and the mean interval between the onset of symptoms and obtaining a definitive diagnosis is approximately 10 years. Currently, laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis; however, this procedure is invasive, carries surgery-related risks, and contributes to diagnostic delay. Therefore, the field has an urgent need for an efficient, sensitive, non-invasive tool for diagnosing endometriosis.

Recently, it was shown that sVCAM-1/sICAM-1 ratio is a promising serum biomarker, which may lead to the development of a new, efficient, sensitive, non-invasive tool for diagnosing endometriosis, thereby potentially avoiding surgical interventions.

Primary aim: To determine whether the serum sVCAM-1/sICAM-1 ratio can be used todiagnose endometriosis.

NCT03430609,Ovarian Function After Use of Various Hemostatic Techniques During Treatment for Endometrioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03430609,Endometrioma,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background: Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity due to causes not yet fully elucidated. The disease affects approximately 2% of women of reproductive age and is associated with infertility. Approximately 17% to 44% of women with endometriosis exhibit endometrioma, or ovarian endometriosis. Laparoscopic cystectomy is currently considered the gold standard treatment for this problem, resulting in improvement of symptoms, a lower recurrence rate and a higher pregnancy rate among infertile patients. However, several studies have shown that this treatment is not free from risks because it is associated with reduction of the ovarian reserve due to accidental removal of ovarian cortex during stripping of the capsule or damage caused by the coagulation energy during hemostasis, even when performed by experienced surgeons. There is still controversy in the literature as to the cause of the reduction of the ovarian reserve, as the mere presence of endometrioma reduces ovarian function by itself. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different hemostatic methods on the ovarian function of women subjected to laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma.

Methods: Open-label randomized clinical trial to be conducted at Lauro Wanderley University Hospital from September 2017 to August 2020. Eighty-four patients will be randomly allocated to three groups according to the hemostatic technique used during laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma: bipolar coagulation, laparoscopic suture and hemostatic matrix. Ovarian function will be assessed by measuring serum anti-Mullerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels and by ultrasound antral follicle counts before surgery and 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. The study was approved by the research ethics committee at the Medical Sciences Center, Federal University of Paraíba CAAE no. 71621717.9.0000.8069.

Discussion: The present study intends to assess the ovarian function of patients with endometrioma subjected to laparoscopic surgical treatment, comparing different hemostatic techniques like bipolar coagulation versus suture versus hemostatic matrix with objective assessments of bipolar coagulation to avoid bias. Thus, the investigators expect to contribute data likely to dispel doubts on the subject.",NO,Endometriosis Ovary|Laparoscopy|Ovary; Functional Disturbance|Hemostasis,PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic treatment for endometrioma Astus©|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: AMH Level|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Transvaginal ultrasound for antral follicle count|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic treatment for endometrioma Vicryl®|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic treatment for endometrioma Surgicel®,"AMH, Antimullerian hormone levels, Before surgery|AMH, Antimullerian hormone levels, 1month after the surgery|AMH, Antimullerian hormone levels, 3 months after the surgery|AMH, Antimullerian hormone levels, 6 months after the surgery","AFC, Ultrasound antral follicle counts, Before surgery|AFC, Ultrasound antral follicle counts, 1month after the procedure|AFC, Ultrasound antral follicle counts, 3 months after the procedure|AFC, Ultrasound antral follicle counts, 6 months after the procedure",,Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São Paulo,Federal University of Paraíba|Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,38,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,U1111-1203-2508|71621717.9.0000.8069,2018-04-01,2020-07-01,2020-08-31,2018-02-13,,2020-07-22,"Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, 58051900, Brazil",
NCT00849173,Global Study of Women's Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00849173,,COMPLETED,"Endometriosis, a condition in which the lining of the uterus grows on nearby tissues, is a common condition that affects women of reproductive age worldwide. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The most common symptom is pelvic pain. This pain may occur at the same time as menstrual bleeding, at other times of the cycle, or during or after sexual intercourse. Previous studies reveal the diagnosis of endometriosis is often delayed between 8 and 12 years after the first symptoms. Women with chronic pelvic pain report a lower quality of life. No studies, however, have been conducted to assess whether women with endometriosis-related pelvic pain are affected differently than those with pelvic pain from other or no identifiable causes.

This large-scale study is designed to gather prospective epidemiological data on the impact of and risk factors for endometriosis across countries worldwide. A study of this scale and scope has never been performed; it is anticipated that the study will provide novel insights into the effects of the condition and associated symptoms on women s lives across different countries, as well as explore differences in the effects of various potential risk factors.

This is an international study conducted at more than 20 sites worldwide and coordinated by Oxford University in the United Kingdom. At the National Institutes of Health, 250 premenopausal women between 18 and 45 years of age who are having their first diagnostic laparoscopy or laparoscopy for tubal sterilization will participate. None will have had a prior diagnosis of endometriosis through surgery. Women will be informed about the study when their laparoscopy is scheduled.

Procedures

* Patient completion of an online questionnaire before scheduled surgery. The following will be assessed by the questionnaire:
* Quality of life
* General gynecologic and medical history

- Some women with endometriosis have chronic pelvic pain. This pain may be caused by spasms of the pelvic floor muscles. These spasms can be detected by an examination. Studies suggest that botulinum toxin can help treat problems caused by muscle spasms. Researchers want to see if botulinum toxin injections into the pelvic floor muscles can decrease pain and spasms in women with pelvic pain.

Objectives:

- To see if botulinum toxin can relieve pain from pelvic floor spasm in women with pelvic pain.

Eligibility:

- Women between 18 and 50 years of age with pain associated with pelvic muscle spasm and endometriosis. Pain must be persistent (lasting for at least 3 months).

Design:

* Participants will keep a pain diary and record their pain medication use for a month before the first visit.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Participants will also answer questions about their pain levels and quality of life.
* Participants will receive either botulinum toxin or a placebo (salt water) injection. The injection will be given into the pelvic floor muscles through the vaginal wall. Participants will take a muscle relaxant like Valium and have anesthetic cream put on the vaginal wall before the injection.
* After the injection, participants will keep a pain diary for another month.
* At a 1-month followup visit, participants will answer questions about their pain. If the pain has not improved, all participants may have a botulinum toxin injection (no placebo) into the pelvic floor muscles as before.

NCT05206279,ICG for Visualization of the Ureters in DIE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05206279,Lavic,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a common condition with an incidence of approximately 10% of all women in the fertile phase. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) has been shown to be associated with high morbidity. A retrospective study of 700 patients has shown lower urinary tract involvement in up to 52.6% of cases with DIE. In most studies, the bladder is cited as the most common site of DIE in the urinary tract, with the ureter being the second most common lesion site. In cases of ureteral endometriosis, a procedure called ureterolysis is essential because complete resection of the endometriosis is necessary to resolve or prevent renal obstruction. In addition, ureterolysis is obligatory in the context of dissection of endometriosis involving the rectovaginal septum, sacrouterine ligaments, or rectum. Ureterolysis is the process of freeing the ureter from both endometriotic nodules as a therapeutic procedure and from physiologic surrounding tissue and structures for complete visualization. Because ureterolysis is a high-risk procedure for ureteral lesions, alternatives are desirable.

ICG is a fluorescent dye that has been used for decades for various indications, including retinal angiography, determination of tissue viability, and testing of cardiac and liver function. It has gained an important role in intraoperative visualization of tissue perfusion as well as sentinel lymph nodes in tumor surgery. ICG has also been used and described for ureteral imageability.

However, these studies included small populations of 10-30 patients. None of the aforementioned studies have investigated the imageability of the ureters in endometriosis and with regard to a possible reduction in the need for ureteral dissection.

The investigators perform a cystoscopy with a retrograde injection of ICG in both ureters. ICG and thus the ureters are visualized during laparoscopy by near-infrared light contained in our camera systems. The additional use of fluorescence imaging of the ureters with ICG injected into the ureters during laparoscopic resection of deep infiltrating endometriosis is intended to improve visualization of the ureters and thus may prevent complete ureterolysis, which is considered a high-risk procedure.

Laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of EM Related infertility is an important method. However, excluding other infertility factors, the natural pregnancy rate of EM patients one year after operation is still significantly lower than that of normal couples. At the same time, the high recurrence rate of EM often requires drugs to inhibit ovulation after operation, which forms a paradox with the demand for fertility. One year after operation is the ""golden period"" of natural pregnancy. Whether to treat the recurrence of EM without affecting or even promoting fertility is a key problem to be solved in clinic. Didroxyprogesterone is the closest natural progesterone. It is widely used in luteal support and treatment of threatened abortion. It does not affect ovulation and is harmless to embryos. In recent years, clinical studies have found that it is helpful to the natural pregnancy of patients with EM after operation, and is beneficial to improve pain symptoms and reduce the recurrence rate. Basic studies have also confirmed the inhibitory effect of didroxyprogesterone on em. However, the existing studies with small sample size are not enough to draw a convincing conclusion that didroxyprogesterone promotes the pregnancy rate after em, and there is a lack of Chinese data.

NCT01757249,Pituitary Down-regulation Before IVF for Women With Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01757249,,TERMINATED,"Endometriosis is a hormone dependent disease of women, in which endometrial tissue (the cells which line the uterus or womb) are found outside the uterus (womb). Some women with endometriosis may be infertile. However, treatments for infertility such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) appear to be less successful, i.e. the pregnancy rates are lower, for women with endometriosis than for women who may be infertile for other reasons.

Since endometriosis is hormone dependent, it has been suggested that suppressing the activity of hormones produced by the ovaries (which affect endometrial growth) may inactivate endometriosis and so increase the chances of pregnancy. Recently it has been proposed that taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for 6 to 8 weeks before IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment could be used for this purpose.

For our study, which is a randomised controlled trial, women with endometriosis meeting the study criteria planning to undergo IVF or IVF-ICSI at the Oxford Fertility Unit will be recruited. Study participants will be randomised into 2 arms: experimental group and control group. The experimental group will be instructed to complete an 8 week course of OCP before beginning standard IVF treatment. The control group do not take any study medication before beginning standard IVF treatment. The IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment for both groups is not altered by participation in the study.

NCT01581905,Study of Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Versus Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy at a Teaching Institution,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01581905,,TERMINATED,"Approximately 600,000 women undergo hysterectomy each year in the United States, of which 12% are laparoscopic. The most common indications for hysterectomy are: symptomatic uterine leiomyomas (40.7%), endometriosis (17.7%), and prolapse (14.5%). The first total laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed by Reich et al in 1988. Many studies have proven that laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with lower preoperative morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and shorter recovery times than abdominal hysterectomy. The literature has also shown the complication rates for laparoscopic cases are similar to open procedures in the hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Gynecologic Practice state that laparoscopic hysterectomy is an alternative to abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. The ACOG Committee on Gynecologic Practice site multiple advantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy to abdominal hysterectomy including faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, and fewer abdominal wall/wound infections. Despite the recommendations of ACOG for a more minimally invasive approach, 66% of all hysterectomies are performed abdominally. Key reasons for the lag in utilization of laparoscopic techniques are the technical obstacles of performing minimally invasive hysterectomies. Robotic technology has emerged as a means to decrease the learning curve and increase the availability of minimally invasive surgery to patients. A current review of the literature reveals no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy vs. robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigator's aim is to address this void.

NCT05837624,Estetrol/Drospirenone to Reduce the Average Size of Endometriomas,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05837624,ERASE,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis, a chronic gynecological disorder associated with pain and infertility, is a common condition affecting approximately one in ten women. Up to 50% of patients with endometriosis have ovarian endometriomas (or ""chocolate cysts""). These cysts directly impact fertility and ovarian reserve (ie. ability to have children) and can cause additional symptoms in women such as added pain, discomfort, and surgical emergencies (cyst rupture, or more rarely twisting). While endometriomas tend to require surgical excision as a solution, medical management with a variety of medications has been shown to be effective in reducing their size.

Medical management (ie. medications and treatments that don't involve surgery) to reduce cyst size can help relieve symptoms either as a long term solution, before fertility treatments, or temporarily until surgery can be offered. Because the COVID-19 pandemic caused significantly reduced access to surgery and resources, medical management has become important for relief of the overburdened healthcare network.

The purpose of this study is to see how effective Estetrol/drospirenone, a combined oral contraceptive (COC), is in the reduction of ovarian endometriomas after a 3- and 6-month period of treatment.

This single arm interventional study will recruit women 18 years or older with an ovarian endometrioma of at least 3cm, who are seeking a hormonal treatment for their endometrioma(s). Consenting participants of the study will take Estetrol/drospirenone once daily, orally, for a 6 month duration.

NCT05298657,The Angiotensin-Melatonin Axis in Poor and Hyper Responders for IVF Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05298657,,UNKNOWN,"According the World Health Organization (WHO), infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. In-vitro-fertilization (IVF) is considered to be a successful tool to overcome infertility. However, the current methods used to assess the ovarian reserve and to develop an optimal individualized controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocol have shown some limitations. Growing evidence indicates that altered renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and/or melatonin are linked to infertility. Aims and Objectives: The current 2 years duration study aims first to investigate the demographic and clinical profiles of patients undergoing IVF in the UAE. In the second phase of the study, we hypothesis that an altered angiotensin-melatonin axis may be considered as an unfavorable prognosis factor in poor and hyper responders undergoing IVF treatment. This hypothesis will be assessed using an observational, longitudinal, prospective clinical study to determine whether the urinary angiotensinogen and/or melatonin deficiency might be present in poor and hyper responders undergoing IVF treatment. Thus, negatively impacting the clinical pregnancy rate. Methodology: various patient's data will be collected using a questionnaire and the levels of angiotensinogen and melatonin in patient's urine will be measured using ELISA test prior to, during and after the IVF treatment. To determine whether the angiotensinogen-melatonin axis disruption affects the IVF treatment outcome, we will analyze the following parameters: the AMH, Antral Follicular Count (AFC), day 2-4 FSH levels, the stimulation cycle in regards to number of stimulation days and amount of gonadotropins used for stimulation, number of oocytes retrieved and number of mature oocytes, quality and embryo's ploidy, number of available euploid embryos and the clinical pregnancy rate after frozen embryo transfer.",NO,"Poor Response to Ovulation Induction|PCOS|Endometriosis|Infertility, Female",,"Differences on urine levels of angiotensinogen-melatonin-creatinine ratio between two groups: one with AMH < 1.1 ng/ml against other with AMH > 6.25 ng/ml., Urinary excretion of angiotensinogen will be analyzed by sandwich-ELISA assay. Urinary melatonin excreted overnight will be determined through the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin molecule.

According to European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines, surgery for endometrioma is recommended when an endometrioma is more than 3 cm in diameter because this management is associated with better spontaneous conception rates. Nevertheless, surgery can also be potentially associated with a risk of destruction of functional ovarian tissue and reduction in ovarian reserve.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the Transforming Growth Factor beta family and is expressed by the small (\<8 mm) pre-antral and early antral follicles. The AMH level reflects the size of the primordial follicle pool, and may be the best biochemical marker of ovarian function across an array of clinical situations Its level in serum is almost stable between 20 and 35 years of the woman´s life, unless using hormonal contraception and / or they suffer with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The level of AMH is also a useful indicator for the prediction chances of success of spontaneous or assisted conceptions. However, there paucity of data regarding changes in serum levels of AMH following surgery for endometrioma.

The condition contributes to chronic pain through mechanisms like inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, and central sensitization.

Central sensitization involves changes in brain function and can be assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While studies have shown the role of brain changes in chronic pain for conditions like migraine and fibromyalgia, research on pain chronicization in endometriosis is limited.

Symptoms include dysmenorrhoea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility. Removal of the endometriotic cyst (chocolate cyst) by surgery is a well-established treatment for symptomatic relief. However, recurrence of endometriotic cyst after surgical removal of the cyst is up to 30-50% after ovarian surgery. Oral contraceptive pills for 18-24 months after the surgery is widely used as a postoperative hormonal therapy because it has been shown to reduce the chance of recurrence of the endometriotic cyst, but recurrence is still high even after taking oral contraceptive pills.

Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. There are some preliminary reports that letrozole can cause shrinkage of endometriotic cysts and improve endometriosis-related pelvic pain by reducing oestrogen level, inflammation and stem cell recruitment that may be important in recurrence of endometriotic cyst. This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. The aim of this study is to assess whether taking letrozole in addition to oral contraceptive pills in the first 6 months after laparoscopic surgery (key-hole surgery) to remove the endometriotic cyst can reduce the risk of recurrence compared to oral contraceptive pills alone.

NCT06426316,The Role of Cytokines and Regulatory T Lymphocytes in Migraine Pathophysiology.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06426316,SIIM,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Migraine is a frequent and debilitating neurologic disorder. It is more frequent in women, and more prevalent in patients with autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and endometriosis, whereas patients with long standing type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - an autoimmune but non inflammatory disease - seem to be less affected compared to the general population. Despite new migraine prevention treatments, a large number of patients remain unresponsive to currently available anti-migraine therapy and migraine pathophysiology remains unclear. Several peptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP-38), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)) and hormones (estrogens, prolactin) and the immune system play an important role in migraine pathophysiology. Among T lymphocytes, regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress inflammation. Studies have evidenced higher levels of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) in migraine patients and have suggested decreased proportions of Treg cells in migraine, as well as in MS, RA, CD and SLE, whereas inflammation declines and Treg levels seem increased in long-standing T1DM. Inflammation, which participates in migraine pain, seems to be a common factor for migraine and these diseases. However, these studies display conflicting results and further investigation is required to better understand the mechanisms behind migraine.

In this study, the investigators will compare Treg levels, as well as identify Treg subpopulations and measure cytokine levels in migraine and migraine-free participants with and without an autoimmune/inflammatory disorder (MS, RA, CD, SLE, T1DM and endometriosis).",NO,Migraine Disorders|Pain|Autoimmune Diseases|Multiple Sclerosis|Endometriosis|Rheumatoid Arthritis|Crohn Disease|Lupus Erythematosus,BIOLOGICAL: Blood test,"Treg cell levels in cell/microliter (cell/µL), To measure Treg cell levels in migraine and migraine-free participants, with and without autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (MS, RA, CD, SLE, endometriosis, T1DM) using flow cytometry, Once, at inclusion|Treg cell levels in percentage (%) of white blood cells, To measure Treg cell levels in migraine and migraine-free participants, with and without autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (MS, RA, CD, SLE, endometriosis, T1DM) using flow cytometry, Once, at inclusion|Age in years, Age at inclusion, Once, at inclusion|Weight in kilograms (kg), Weight on scales during inclusion visit, Once, at inclusion|Score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Score to be answered at inclusion to determine anxiety and depression levels : ranges from 0 to 21 for each (anxiety and depression).

Although endometriosis is classified in four stage (minimal, mild, moderate, severe), from the clinical point of view it is possible to subdivide among peritoneal superficial lesions, ovarian endometriomas and Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE).

According to the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Guideline on the management of women with endometriosis, it is recommended to clinicians that in infertile women with endometrioma larger than 3 cm, cystectomy should be considered prior to Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) to improve endometriosis-associated pain or the accessibility of follicles. They further recommend that clinicians counsel women with endometrioma regarding the risks of reduced ovarian function after surgery, the possible loss of the ovary, and consider that the decision to proceed with surgery should be taken carefully if the woman has had previous ovarian surgery.

In addition, this Guideline suggests that clinicians can prescribe prolonged (3-6 months) pituitary downregulation with Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone-agonists (GnRH-a) prior to ART, in order to increase live birth rate by four-fold.

Dysmenorrhea is defined as a painful, cramping sensation in the lower abdomen or back associated with menstrual periods and is classified into primary and secondary types. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual periods not due to other diseases, and often occurs soon after menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea is due to an underlying pelvic abnormality, such as endometriosis.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological complaint. In many studies, the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea varies between 34 % in 2010 in Egypt, 86.6% in 2002 in Switzerland, and 21% in 1999 in France.

Nowadays, physiopathology is better understood, which suggests that the investigators have treatments Although dysmenorrhea is a common concern, many women never seek medical advice, even though treatments are easily available and simple.

In fact, despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is undertreated and even disregarded by health professionals, and the girls themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the menstrual cycle.

The pain occurs just before and/or during menstruation ; it can be mild to severe and is frequently associated with many other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, tiredness and has many consequences in wellbeing and school. Dysmenorrhea is known to be the first cause of absenteism from school, and appears to have many consequences and a real impact on women's daily activities, which is why it's a public health problem.

Because of the lack of recent studies in France, the aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of adolescent dysmenorrhea. The investigators also assessed its severity, how adolescent girls experienced their menses, and how they manage their pain (seeking medical consultation, use of medication).

Being able to measure whether psychological distress is related to living with a LTC would allow researchers and clinicians to provide interventions specifically tailored to the challenges of living with a LTC and therefore provide the most appropriate support for these patients. Such a measure would also be useful in research to identify the presence of illness-related distress in different patient groups. This project will therefore create a new measure of illness-related distress that has applications for both research and clinical practice. This will involve the psychometric validation of the new illness-related distress measure to test how valid and reliable the measure is.

The aim of the project is to provide initial validation of the Illness Related Distress Scale in a community sample, recruited through online platforms.
